/**
 * services/classSessionService.js
 *
 * A Class Session is the thing a teacher is actually conducting during
 * Class Mode — not a series of independent database writes. Every
 * action during a session (star, behaviour point, notebook update,
 * recognition) already mutates the in-memory classroom object exactly
 * as it did before this existed (see classModeService.js — unchanged);
 * what changes is that nothing calls workspaceService.save() per
 * action anymore. This service is what turns "a pile of in-memory
 * mutations" into something a teacher can review, save as one
 * intentional write, or throw away entirely.
 *
 * In-memory only, per classroom, exactly like classModeService's own
 * undo stack (which this sits alongside, not on top of) — never
 * written to Firestore itself. A session's only two possible endings
 * are: commitSession() (the one and only permanent write) or
 * discardSession() (nothing written, in-memory draft state thrown
 * away by re-fetching the classroom from Firestore).
