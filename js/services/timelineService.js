/**
 * services/timelineService.js
 *
 * Reads and appends to a Student's Timeline — the append-only log
 * backing "Current Session Score", "Total Positive Points", "Total
 * Negative Points", and the profile's Activity tab (see
 * models/Student.js's `history` field). `score` is a derived cache kept
 * in sync with this log, not the source of truth itself.
 *
 * Every domain service that changes something worth remembering about a
 * student — badgeService (award/revoke), noteService (add), bucketService
 * (change), learningActivityService (status set) — logs through here, so
 * the Timeline reads as one unified chronological record rather than
 * several disconnected logs. This is scoped to the Student Profile's own
 * "Log Participation" control for points specifically — a separate,
 * minimal way to record a point change with a reason. It is not the
 * click-a-team-card scoring system referenced elsewhere in the project's
 * history, which remains a future milestone.
