# Changelog

All notable changes to Classroom Tracker are documented in this file, one entry per implementation phase.

---

## Phase 1 — Progress Engine & Foundation (Recognition/Dashboard groundwork)

**Scope:** computation and infrastructure only. No UI redesign, no new screens, no new navigation. Verified via full regression smoke test that existing functionality (classroom creation, Class Mode scoring, Settings, Notebook Tracker's Register/Timeline views, Student Profile) behaves identically to before this phase.

### Features Added
- **Weekly/monthly Progress Engine**: `studentProgressService` can now compute stars, ranks, streaks, and notebook completion scoped to a Monday-start week, a calendar month, or all-time — all derived from existing, permanent data (`student.history`, `classroom.notebooks`); nothing new is stored for this.
- **Recognition computation engine**: configuration-driven recognition categories (Star Performer, Longest Learning Streak, Notebook Champion, Team Champion, Biggest Climber) with automatic co-winner support — ties are never artificially broken.
- **Leaderboard computation**: one reusable ranked-list function per category, shared by recognition-winner lookup and full leaderboard display.
- **Biggest Climber**: rank-movement-based (not simple star-delta), with star total as a documented secondary tie-breaker, and exclusion of students with no tracked history before the comparison period.
- **Pending Tasks framework**: three initial checkers (notebook not checked today, activities awaiting completion, homework awaiting review), each independently extensible via config.
- **Continue Working infrastructure**: per-teacher (not classroom-shared) "recently opened notebooks" read/write path, capped at 5, most-recent-first. **Not yet wired to any UI call site** — see Breaking Changes/Deferred below.
- **Role & membership scaffolding**: `STUDENT` and `PARENT` added to `MEMBER_ROLES` as provider-agnostic placeholders (no permissions, no auth path). A reserved, unused `classroomJoinCode` field added to the Classroom model, documenting the future joining flow's plug-in point without implementing it.

### Files Created
- `src/js/config/recognitionCategories.js`
- `src/js/config/pendingTaskTypes.js`
- `src/js/services/pendingTaskService.js`
- `src/js/services/continueWorkingService.js`
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
- `docs/PROGRESS_ENGINE.md` — architecture, full function reference, weekly/monthly rules, tie handling, the Biggest Climber algorithm, recognition/leaderboard/pending-task computation, and a Performance Notes section (complexity, bottlenecks, and documented-only future caching opportunities)

### Files Modified
- `src/js/services/studentProgressService.js` — major expansion (see Features Added); prior functions (`getCompletionPercent`, `getCurrentStreak`, `getBestStreak`, `getLastChecked`) unchanged.
- `src/js/config/memberRoles.js` — added `STUDENT`/`PARENT` roles with empty permission sets.
- `src/js/models/Classroom.js` — added reserved `classroomJoinCode` field (default `null`).
- `src/js/services/classroomService.js` — backfills `classroomJoinCode` for classrooms saved before this field existed.
- `src/js/utils/dateHelpers.js` — added `getMondayStartOfWeek`, `getWeekRange`, `getPreviousWeekRange`, `getMonthRange`, `isDateKeyInRange`.
- `src/js/repositories/classroomRepository.js` — added `recordRecentNotebook`/`subscribeToRecentNotebooks` to the interface.
- `src/js/repositories/firestoreClassroomRepository.js` — implemented the above two methods (transaction-guarded, capped-at-5 write to the existing `users/{uid}` document — no new collection).

### Breaking Changes
None. Every addition is new files or additive fields/functions; nothing existing was renamed or removed.

### Deferred (deliberately, within this phase)
- `continueWorkingService.recordRecentNotebook()` is fully built and tested but **not called from anywhere yet** — wiring it into `NotebookRegisterView.js` is deferred to Phase 2, since that's when the Dashboard widget that consumes this data exists. Calling it now would be an invisible-but-real new Firestore write triggered by using the app today, which this phase's "no behavior change" constraint was meant to avoid.

### New Services Introduced
- `pendingTaskService` (read-only)
- `continueWorkingService` (the one write-capable addition this phase — personal-to-teacher, not classroom-shared)

### New Configuration Files
- `recognitionCategories.js` — extensible recognition category registry
- `pendingTaskTypes.js` — extensible pending-task-type registry

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **"Stars" = positive points only.** Deductions never count toward a star total, matching the app's existing "Total Positive Points" concept and its established visual-language rule that stars are always a positive-only metric.
- **Standard competition ranking** (ties share a rank; the next distinct value skips accordingly) used everywhere, so "celebrate co-winners, never artificially break ties" falls out of the ranking algorithm itself rather than needing special-case logic per category.
- **Leaderboards are always complete** (every student/team, including zero-value entries) for teacher browsing; **recognition winners additionally require a non-zero winning value**, so an empty or brand-new classroom doesn't crown a winner who earned nothing.
- **Longest Streak, when scoped to a week or month, means the longest complete-in-a-row run that occurred within that specific date range** (naturally capped at ~7 or ~31), not a student's all-time current streak — a different, period-bounded calculation from the existing Student-Profile-facing `getCurrentStreak`/`getBestStreak`, which remain unchanged and unbounded.
- **Biggest Climber's "did this student exist before now" check compares against the start of the *current* period, not the previous period.** (Corrected during implementation — an earlier draft compared against the previous period's start, which incorrectly excluded students whose earliest-ever activity happened to fall exactly on that boundary date. Caught by a test that deliberately used that exact edge case.)
- **Continue Working is scoped to `users/{uid}`, not the classroom document** — reusing the same per-account document already used for the migration flag, rather than introducing a new collection.
- **Pending Tasks' "homework awaiting review" is defined generically** (any notebook type, not just ones literally named "Homework") as "submitted but not yet assessed," since matching on a type's display name would be fragile.
- **`continueWorkingService.recordOpened()` renamed to `recordRecentNotebook()`** (post-Phase-1 review) — considered and rejected a broader `recordWorkspace()` name, since the function only ever accepts a notebook-shaped payload and Continue Working was explicitly scoped to notebooks in the approved brief. A generic name over a notebook-shaped payload would overstate current capability rather than future-proof it; the chosen name instead matches the repository method it wraps (`repository.recordRecentNotebook`) precisely. If Continue Working later broadens to other kinds of recent work, that's the point to design the richer shape and rename again — the same pattern already used once in this project (`notebookCheckService` → `notebookService`).

### Future TODOs
- Wire `continueWorkingService.recordRecentNotebook()` into `NotebookRegisterView.js` (Phase 2).
- Build the Classroom Dashboard consuming Recognition Wall / Weekly Snapshot / Continue Working / Pending Tasks (Phase 2).
- Build the dedicated Recognition screen and Leaderboard UI (Phase 3).
- Build the teacher-only Student Dashboard preview (Phase 4) — no authentication, no student accounts.
- Student/Parent onboarding (Class Code/QR joining, real authentication) remains blocked pending AI Working Committee review; `STUDENT`/`PARENT` roles and `classroomJoinCode` exist only as unused placeholders until then.

## Phase 2 — Classroom Dashboard

**Scope:** navigation, layout, and information architecture. No theming, no animation — explicitly deferred to Phase 5 per the phase plan. Verified via full regression testing (screenshots + Playwright) that every pre-existing screen (Notebook Tracker, Register View, Timeline View, Settings tabs, Class Mode scoring, deep-linking/page-reload) continues to work.

### Features Added
- **Classroom Dashboard**: the new default landing page at `/classroom/{id}`, replacing Class Mode as the first thing a teacher sees. Assembled entirely from independent, reusable widgets — no functionality duplicated from Notebook Tracker, Settings, or Class Mode.
- **Seven widgets**, each its own component: `RecognitionWidget`, `WeeklySnapshotWidget`, `ContinueWorkingWidget`, `PendingTasksWidget`, `SubjectsWidget`, `GroupsWidget`, `ClassModeWidget` — every one with a thoughtful, distinct empty state, verified on a brand-new classroom.
- **Class Mode relocated, not modified**: now reached via `/classroom/{id}/class-mode` through the Dashboard's "Start Class Mode" button. `TrackerView.js` itself has zero internal changes; only what routes into it and where its "Back" button returns to.
- **Continue Working's deferred Phase 1 wiring completed**: `continueWorkingService.recordRecentNotebook()` now has its first real call site, in `main.js`'s route dispatch for `notebookRegister` — firing on genuine navigation to a notebook, not on every internal re-render (e.g. marking a student). Verified end-to-end: opening a notebook and returning to the Dashboard shows it in Continue Working.
- **`getRecentNotebooksOnce()`** added to the repository/service layer — a one-time read, deliberately not a live subscription (see Architectural Decisions below).

### Files Created
- `src/js/ui/views/DashboardView.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/RecognitionWidget.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/WeeklySnapshotWidget.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/ContinueWorkingWidget.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/PendingTasksWidget.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/SubjectsWidget.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/GroupsWidget.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/ClassModeWidget.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/router.js` — `/classroom/{id}` (bare) now resolves to `'dashboard'` instead of `'tracker'`; added `/classroom/{id}/class-mode` → `'tracker'`.
- `src/js/main.js` — added the `dashboard` route render branch; `tracker` route's `onBack` now returns to the Dashboard instead of Home; added the `recordRecentNotebook()` call site for the `notebookRegister` route.
- `src/js/repositories/classroomRepository.js` / `firestoreClassroomRepository.js` — added `getRecentNotebooksOnce(uid)` (one-time read, alongside the existing live `subscribeToRecentNotebooks`).
- `src/js/services/continueWorkingService.js` — added `getRecentOnce(uid)` wrapping the above.
- `src/css/styles.css` — minimal structural CSS for the new widgets (layout/spacing only, no visual polish, per this phase's explicit scope).

### Routing Changes
| Path | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `/classroom/{id}` | Class Mode (Tracker) | **Classroom Dashboard** |
| `/classroom/{id}/class-mode` | *(did not exist)* | Class Mode (Tracker) — unchanged internally |

Every other existing route (`settings`, `setup`, `student`, `activities`, `notebooks`, `notebooks/.../timeline`) is unchanged. Every `onBack`/`onFinish` callback that already pointed at bare `/classroom/{id}` now naturally lands on the Dashboard instead of Class Mode — no additional call sites needed updating beyond the one described above.

### Breaking Changes
None for end users — every existing screen and interaction is reachable and behaves identically to before. The one behavioral change is intentional and specified: the classroom's landing page is now the Dashboard instead of Class Mode.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Subjects widget does not truly filter Notebook Tracker to one subject.** Clicking a subject navigates to the existing, unfiltered Notebook Tracker list (which already groups by subject). True filtering would require modifying `NotebookTrackerView.js`, which this phase's "existing modules remain their existing implementation" constraint argues against. Flagged for a decision rather than built silently — see the design-concerns note at the start of this phase's implementation.
- **Continue Working uses a one-time read, not a live subscription**, inside the Dashboard widget. This app has no view-unmount/cleanup mechanism — every prior live subscription lives at the `main.js`/app level, where a full-page re-render naturally supersedes the old one. A view-scoped subscription on `users/{uid}` (a document separate from the classroom, so the existing classroom listener can't cover it) would leak a listener on every Dashboard visit without a cleanup hook this app doesn't have yet. A one-time read was judged an honest, sufficient tradeoff for this feature's actual need ("what did I recently open, before this visit"), rather than introducing new lifecycle machinery to solve a problem this specific widget doesn't really have.
- **`recordRecentNotebook()` is called from `main.js`'s route dispatch, not from inside `NotebookRegisterView.js`'s render function.** The view's render function is also called internally (via its own `rerender()` closure) for actions like marking a student, which shouldn't re-trigger "recently opened" bookkeeping. Routing through `main.js` means the call fires only on genuine navigation to a notebook (including day-to-day navigation, which does route through `main.js`), not on every in-place UI update.
- **"Reports" is a disabled placeholder button, not a widget.** It has never been built in this app (only ever a planned nav item); this phase gives it the same "Coming Soon"-style treatment already established for the Teachers tab's invite button, rather than building a stub screen or a fake widget with no real data behind it.
- **Weekly Snapshot's "Weekly Stars" figure is a classroom-wide total** (sum across every student), distinct from the "Weekly Leaderboard" preview immediately below it (top 3 by individual rank, full tie inclusion). Read together, they answer "how much happened this week" and "who's leading" as two different questions rather than one being a subset view of the other.
- **Recognition Wall omits categories with no winner individually** rather than showing a "no winner" placeholder per category; the widget only shows one overall empty state if literally nothing has any winner yet. Matches "every widget should have a thoughtful empty state" as a single, whole-widget message rather than a repeated one.

### Future TODOs
- True per-subject filtering for the Subjects widget (currently opens the full Notebook Tracker list) — pending your decision on whether it's worth a small, scoped addition to `NotebookTrackerView.js`.
- Build the dedicated Recognition screen and Leaderboard UI (Phase 3).
- Build the teacher-only Student Dashboard preview (Phase 4) — no authentication, no student accounts.
- Student/Parent onboarding remains blocked pending AI Working Committee review.
- Visual/theme/animation polish for the Dashboard and its widgets — explicitly deferred to Phase 5.

## Phase 2 Refactor — Grouped Dashboard Hierarchy

**Context:** a design-first review (requested before this refactor, after Phase 2's initial implementation had already shipped) proposed grouping the Dashboard's flat widget list into two labeled sections — "Teaching" and "Classroom" — so the page more clearly answers four questions in order: what to celebrate, what needs attention, what to do next, and how the classroom is organized. Approved and implemented as a **structural refactor**, not a rebuild: every existing widget component is reused completely unchanged.

### What Changed
- `DashboardView.js`'s assembly logic: Recognition Wall and Weekly Snapshot remain ungrouped at the top (equal visual weight, both answering "what to celebrate"); Continue Working and Pending Tasks remain ungrouped immediately below (both answering "what needs attention"); Start Class Mode, Subjects, and a new Activities placeholder are now grouped under a "Teaching" heading; Groups, Reports, and Settings are now grouped under a "Classroom" heading.
- Start Class Mode is listed first within Teaching for visual priority, matching its status as the single most-performed daily action — using its existing, already-larger CTA styling rather than any new visual treatment.
- Reports and Settings moved from a standalone `actionsRow` into the new Classroom section (same buttons, same behavior, different container).
- Added an "Activities" placeholder (disabled, "Coming soon") inside Teaching — see Architectural Decisions below for why this doesn't conflict with the fact that Learning Activities already exists as a working feature elsewhere in the app.

### What Was Intentionally Left Unchanged
- **Every widget component file** (`RecognitionWidget.js`, `WeeklySnapshotWidget.js`, `ContinueWorkingWidget.js`, `PendingTasksWidget.js`, `SubjectsWidget.js`, `GroupsWidget.js`, `ClassModeWidget.js`) — zero code changes. The refactor only changed which container each one is appended to.
- **No renames.** `ClassModeWidget`/`GroupsWidget` were considered for a `...Card` rename to match an example tree, but rejected: renaming just these two would introduce a second naming convention alongside `RecognitionWidget`/`WeeklySnapshotWidget`/etc., reducing consistency rather than improving it. Per the explicit instruction to avoid cosmetic-only renames, they keep their existing names.
- **Routing** — unchanged from the original Phase 2 implementation (`/classroom/{id}` → Dashboard, `/classroom/{id}/class-mode` → Tracker). This refactor is a rendering/layout change only.
- **Responsiveness** — still single-column at every breakpoint, matching every other screen in this app. Multi-column layout experimentation is explicitly deferred to Phase 5.
- **Continue Working's one-time-read design** (vs. a live subscription) — unchanged; still the right call for the reasons documented in the original Phase 2 entry above.

### Files Created
- `src/js/ui/components/TeachingSection.js` — lightweight layout wrapper (heading + children), no data source or service of its own.
- `src/js/ui/components/ClassroomSection.js` — same pattern, for the Classroom grouping.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/views/DashboardView.js` — restructured assembly logic (see "What Changed" above); added two small inline placeholder-button helpers (`createActivitiesPlaceholder`, `createReportsPlaceholder`) and a `createSettingsButton` helper, replacing the previous flat `actionsRow`.
- `src/css/styles.css` — removed the now-unused `.dashboard-view__actions-row`/`.dashboard-widget__actions-row` rule; added minimal structural CSS for `.dashboard-section`/`.dashboard-section__heading`/`.dashboard-section__group` (layout only — no color/theme changes).

### Regression Verification
Full Playwright pass confirmed: section headings render correctly grouping the intended children; Settings navigation from the Classroom section works; Subjects widget (now inside Teaching) still navigates to Notebook Tracker; Groups widget (now inside Classroom) still navigates to Settings › Groups; Start Class Mode still launches Class Mode unchanged; Back from Class Mode still returns to the Dashboard. Pending Tasks correctly reflected real state (a configured-but-unchecked notebook) against the refactored layout. **No functionality regressed** — confirmed by direct testing, not by inspection alone.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **TeachingSection/ClassroomSection are composition-only**, per instruction — no data fetching, no service imports, no empty state of their own (they can't be empty; they always have their fixed set of children).
- **The Activities placeholder does not conflict with the already-existing, fully-working Learning Activities feature** (reachable via Class Mode's header, unmodified). The placeholder is specifically about the *Dashboard* not yet having its own direct entry point to that feature — not about the feature being unbuilt. Flagging this explicitly since "Activities (future placeholder)" could otherwise read as a regression to someone who already uses Learning Activities today; it isn't one.
- **Reports and Settings render as full-width stacked buttons** within the Classroom section's single-column group, rather than the previous right-aligned row — a direct, minimal consequence of reusing the same `.dashboard-section__group` layout as every other section, not a deliberate visual decision (visual polish remains a Phase 5 concern).

### Future TODOs
(Unchanged from the original Phase 2 entry — this refactor didn't add or resolve any.)

---

## Phase 3 — Recognition Experience

**Scope:** a dedicated Recognition Screen, two newly-extracted reusable components (`RecognitionCard`, `LeaderboardList`), and the routing/navigation connecting it to the Dashboard's existing Recognition Wall. Implemented in the approved order: extract `RecognitionCard` → extract `LeaderboardList` → build `RecognitionScreenView` → wire Dashboard "View All" → routing → regression testing → documentation. The Progress Engine (`studentProgressService.js`) was not modified at all this phase — every new screen and component consumes functions that already existed from Phase 1.

### Features Added
- **Recognition Screen** (`/classroom/{id}/recognition/{period?}/{categoryId?}`): period tabs (This Week / This Month / All Time), categories grouped by purpose (🏆 Performance, 📈 Growth, 🤝 Team, ⭐ Special Recognition), a full Winner Card for the selected category/period, and its leaderboard embedded directly below with in-place expand/collapse ("Show all" / "Show less" — no navigation, no separate page).
- **`RecognitionCard`**, extracted from a private function inside `RecognitionWidget.js` into its own reusable component with two variants: `compact` (Dashboard Wall — icon, label, names only) and `full` (Recognition Screen — adds reason, a prominently-formatted key statistic, and the period). Handles co-winners (never truncated) and a distinct Team Champion presentation (group icon + team name, not student initials).
- **`LeaderboardList`**, extracted as a fully generic, reusable ranked-list component — knows nothing about recognition categories, only renders whatever `entries`/`formatValue` it's given.
- **Recognition config extended**: `recognitionCategories.js` gained a `group` field (replacing the earlier, effectively-unused `kind`/`RECOGNITION_KINDS`), a `reasonText` per category (the Card's "Why?" answer), and a new `FUTURE_RECOGNITION_PLACEHOLDERS` list (Most Improved, Teacher's Choice, Most Helpful, Best Reader, Best Speaker, Creative Thinker, Perfect Attendance) rendered as visibly-disabled chips on the Recognition Screen — communicating "more is coming" without any computed data or fake resolver behind them.
- **Dashboard "View All"**: a small link in the Recognition Wall's header, navigating to the Recognition Screen at its default period/category.
- **Category/period auto-redirect**: selecting a period that the current category doesn't support (e.g. switching to "All Time" while viewing Biggest Climber, which only supports week/month) redirects to the first category that *does* support it, keeping the URL always valid and shareable rather than silently rendering a mismatched state.

### Files Created
- `src/js/ui/components/RecognitionCard.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/LeaderboardList.js`
- `src/js/ui/views/RecognitionScreenView.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/js/config/recognitionCategories.js` — `kind`/`RECOGNITION_KINDS` replaced with `group`/`RECOGNITION_GROUPS`/`RECOGNITION_GROUP_LABELS`/`RECOGNITION_GROUP_ORDER`; added `reasonText` per category; added `FUTURE_RECOGNITION_PLACEHOLDERS`.
- `src/js/ui/components/RecognitionWidget.js` — now consumes the shared `RecognitionCard` (compact variant) instead of its own private card-building function; added the "View All" link.
- `src/js/ui/views/DashboardView.js` — threads `onOpenRecognition` through to the Recognition widget.
- `src/js/ui/router.js` — added `/classroom/{id}/recognition/{period?}/{categoryId?}`.
- `src/js/main.js` — added `'recognition'` to the classroom route names; added the route dispatch branch; wired `onOpenRecognition` on the dashboard route.
- `src/css/styles.css` — replaced the old flat `.recognition-card` rules (compact-only) with variant-aware rules (`--compact`/`--full`), co-winner row layout, and new rules for the Recognition Screen's tabs/chips and the Leaderboard List.

### Routing Changes
| Path | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `/classroom/{id}/recognition` | Recognition Screen, defaults to this week / first available category |
| `/classroom/{id}/recognition/{period}` | Recognition Screen, period selected, first available category for it |
| `/classroom/{id}/recognition/{period}/{categoryId}` | Both selected — deep-linkable and shareable |

No other existing route changed.

### Breaking Changes
None. `RECOGNITION_KINDS` was exported but never actually consumed anywhere in rendering logic (confirmed by grep before removing it) — its replacement by `group` has no observable effect on anything built in Phases 1–2.

### Regression Verification
Full Playwright pass confirmed: co-winner ties render correctly on both the Dashboard Wall and the Recognition Screen; all four group headings and all seven disabled placeholder chips render; the leaderboard's "Show all"/"Show less" toggle works in place with zero navigation; period-switching correctly auto-redirects away from a category that doesn't support the new period (Biggest Climber + All Time); empty states render correctly for a category with no winner. Separately, a full regression pass confirmed every Phase 1/2 feature (Settings, Notebook Tracker, Register View, Timeline View, Class Mode scoring, Dashboard's Teaching/Classroom sections) continues to work unchanged.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The Progress Engine was not touched.** Every new screen/component consumes `getRecognitionWinners()`/`getLeaderboard()` exactly as Phase 1 built them — Phase 3 is purely a presentation-layer expansion, matching the explicit instruction to implement "using the existing Progress Engine without modifying its architecture."
- **`FUTURE_RECOGNITION_PLACEHOLDERS` is a separate list from `RECOGNITION_CATEGORIES`**, not the same array with a "disabled" flag — keeping real, computable categories and inert placeholders structurally distinct means `getRecognitionWinners()`/`getLeaderboard()` never need to special-case "a category with no resolver."
- **Formatting logic (key statistic strings, leaderboard value strings) lives in the UI layer** (`RecognitionCard.js`, `RecognitionScreenView.js`), not in config or the Progress Engine — `studentProgressService.js` returns plain structured data (numbers, names, ranks) only; every "5 Stars" / "12-Day Streak" / "+4 Rank Positions" string is assembled at render time from that data. This is also precisely what makes the future-certificate design goal achievable without engine changes.
- **`LeaderboardList` deliberately has zero knowledge of recognition categories** — it accepts entries and a `formatValue` function from its caller, so it's genuinely reusable (e.g. for a future dedicated Group Leaderboard) rather than reusable in name only.

### Future TODOs
- True per-subject filtering for the Subjects widget (carried over from Phase 2 — still unresolved).
- Build the teacher-only Student Dashboard preview (Phase 4) — no authentication, no student accounts.
- Printable certificate / Wall of Fame / assembly-announcement presentation of `RecognitionCard` — designed for, not built.
- Teacher's Choice, once implemented, needs its own explicitly write-capable service (e.g. `teacherChoiceService.js`), kept separate from the read-only Progress Engine — see the Phase 3 design discussion.
- Perfect Attendance needs an attendance data source before it can move from placeholder to computed category.
- Student/Parent onboarding remains blocked pending AI Working Committee review.
- Visual/theme/animation polish — explicitly deferred to Phase 5.

## Phase 4 — Teacher Productivity (Header Consolidation)

**Context:** a design-first review of teacher workflow friction concluded that the Dashboard's real gap wasn't missing features but redundant navigation for the two highest-frequency needs (starting Class Mode, resuming a recently-opened notebook) — both already existed and worked, just positioned mid-page behind celebratory content. Rather than adding a new "Quick Start" widget (my original proposal), a simpler approach was approved: **relocate** both into a slot-based header, with zero duplication.

### Features Added
- **`ClassroomHeader`**: a new, generic slot-based header component (`Primary Action` / `Secondary Content` / `Classroom Context`) — deliberately not coupled to any specific widget, so a future phase can change what fills either slot without touching this file.
- **Start Class Mode relocated** into the header's Primary Action slot — visible with zero scrolling the instant a teacher opens a classroom. Removed from the Teaching section (not duplicated).
- **Continue Working relocated** into the header's Secondary Content slot — same one-time-read loading pattern as before, just appending into a different container. Removed from its previous mid-page position (not duplicated).
- **Activities upgraded from a disabled placeholder to a real shortcut** into the existing, already-built Learning Activities feature (`ActivitiesView.js`) — the feature itself was never unbuilt; the Dashboard simply hadn't grown a direct link to it until now.
- **Pending Tasks made actionable**: each item is now clickable (via a new `onSelectTask` callback), deep-linking straight to the relevant Notebook Register View or Activity roster. No changes to `pendingTaskService.js` itself — every checker already returned everything a link needs (`subjectId`/`notebookTypeId`/`dateKey`, or `activityId`).

### Files Created
- `src/js/ui/components/ClassroomHeader.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/views/DashboardView.js` — assembles the new header; removed `ClassModeWidget` from the Teaching section and the old `continueWorkingSlot` from mid-page content; Activities placeholder replaced with a real link; Pending Tasks now receives `onSelectPendingTask`.
- `src/js/ui/components/PendingTasksWidget.js` — items render as buttons (via the optional `onSelectTask` callback) rather than plain text when the callback is provided.
- `src/js/main.js` — added `onOpenActivities` and `onSelectPendingTask` to the dashboard route; the latter interprets each Pending Task item's shape (`activityId` vs. `subjectId`+`notebookTypeId`(+`dateKey`)) to build the correct navigation target.
- `src/css/styles.css` — structural CSS for the header's three slots and the clickable Pending Task links (layout only, no visual polish).

### Breaking Changes
None. Every relocation removes a widget from exactly one place and adds it to exactly one other — confirmed by direct testing that "Start Class Mode" and "Continue Working" each appear exactly once on the page, never zero, never two.

### Regression Verification
Full Playwright pass confirmed: header renders both slots correctly on a brand-new classroom; neither Start Class Mode nor Continue Working appears anywhere else on the page; the Activities link is genuinely enabled and navigates to the real Learning Activities list; a Pending Task for an unchecked notebook deep-links to its Register View (today, no explicit date needed) and disappears from the list once marked; a Pending Task for an activity awaiting completion deep-links to that activity's roster; Class Mode via the header still launches correctly and "Back" still returns to the Dashboard; the Recognition Screen remains reachable via "View All." Every Phase 1–3 capability continues to work.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **`ClassroomHeader` is intentionally generic**, per the explicit design refinement — it exposes three named slots and has no knowledge of what's inside them. This phase fills Primary Action and Secondary Content with existing, unmodified widgets; a future phase could put something else in either slot without any change to this component.
- **Notebook quick-open was explicitly not built.** Continue Working only covers notebooks opened recently; a specific, not-recently-opened notebook still requires the Subjects → Notebook Tracker path. Assessed as the lowest-frequency of the identified needs and deliberately deferred rather than added to the header, per the explicit decision to keep the header simplification narrow rather than reintroducing scope it was meant to avoid.
- **Recently Viewed Students was explicitly not built**, per the approved scope — remains a recommended future feature, intentionally kept independent from Continue Working rather than merged into a broader "recent work" concept (see the Phase 4 design discussion's trade-off analysis).
- **Award Stars was explicitly rejected as a Dashboard shortcut** — awarding a star outside Class Mode's existing Undo-stack-aware flow risks fragmenting the one coherent scoring model this app deliberately built; Class Mode continues to be the only way to award stars.
- **Pending Task navigation logic lives in `main.js`, not inside `PendingTasksWidget.js`** — consistent with this app's established pattern (e.g. the Notebook Register's `recordRecentNotebook` call site) of keeping routing decisions at the `main.js` dispatch boundary, with components themselves staying free of `router` imports.

### Future TODOs
- Notebook quick-open (a flat shortcut list of configured notebook types, skipping the Notebook Tracker list screen) — identified as a real but lower-priority gap; not scheduled.
- Recently Viewed Students — approved in principle as a future, independent widget following Continue Working's exact one-time-read pattern; not scheduled.
- Build the teacher-only Student Dashboard preview (Phase "Student Preview") — no authentication, no student accounts.
- Printable certificate / Wall of Fame / assembly-announcement presentation of `RecognitionCard` — designed for, not built.
- Teacher's Choice, once implemented, needs its own explicitly write-capable service, kept separate from the read-only Progress Engine.
- Perfect Attendance needs an attendance data source before it can move from placeholder to computed category.
- Student/Parent onboarding remains blocked pending AI Working Committee review.
- Visual/theme/animation polish — explicitly deferred.

## Phase 5 — Theme & Motion System

**Scope:** a unified design-token system (color, spacing, radius, elevation, typography, font-weight, motion) and a small, purpose-first motion layer, applied across the existing UI. No new features — every stage was verified to change nothing functionally except where a fix was explicitly warranted (see the accessibility contrast fixes below). Implemented in the approved reorder: **1. Design tokens → 2. Theme migration → 3. Component cleanup → 4. Accessibility pass → 5. Motion rollout**, testing after each stage.

### A correction made before Stage 1

The original design proposal invented arbitrary hex values for Success (`#2f9e5b`) and a Recognition-specific accent (`#c8952a`). Before writing any tokens, the project's actual TFI brand guide (`tfi-brand` skill) was checked — it already documents **TFI Lime Green (`#B7C930`)** as the brand's "secondary accent" and **TFI Orange (`#FF9629`)** as "warm accent, highlights." Both were used instead of the invented values — Success = Lime Green, Accent = Orange (per the approved rename from a Recognition-specific token to a general one). Warning (TFI Yellow) and Danger (TFI Red-Orange) were already brand-correct and unchanged.

### Features Added — Stage 1 (Design tokens)
Purely additive; verified via screenshot comparison that nothing rendered differently. Added to `:root`: semantic color aliases (`--color-primary`, `--color-primary-strong`, `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-accent`), a 7-step spacing scale (`--space-1` … `--space-7`), a pill radius token, a 5-level elevation scale (`--elevation-flat` → `--elevation-card` → `--elevation-hover` → `--elevation-sheet` → `--elevation-dialog`), a typography scale (`--text-xs` … `--text-2xl`), font-weight tokens (`--font-weight-regular/medium/bold/black`), and motion tokens (`--duration-instant/fast/base/celebratory`, one shared `--ease-standard`).

### Features Added — Stage 2 (Theme migration)
Every component-level reference to `--color-cyan`/`--color-cyan-dark`/`--shadow-card` migrated to the new semantic names (`--color-primary`/`--color-primary-strong`/`--elevation-card`). Pure rename — verified the computed color still resolves to the exact original TFI Cyan value (`rgb(14, 192, 226)`) after migration.

### Features Added — Stage 3 (Component cleanup)
- Every `font-weight` numeric value tokenized (600/700/800 all had exact token matches — zero visual change).
- Every hardcoded `border-radius: 999px` tokenized to `--radius-pill`.
- Recognition Cards given a distinct visual identity: a 3px top border in the new Accent color (TFI Orange) — the one genuinely new visual element in this stage, scoped narrowly to where it was designed to matter.
- The sixth and final button interaction state, **loading**, added (`[aria-busy="true"]`) — static appearance only at this stage (dimmed, a ring shown but not yet spinning), since the actual spin is motion and this stage was expressly the visual system, not motion.

### Features Added — Stage 4 (Accessibility pass)
- **A real WCAG AA contrast failure found and fixed**, not just documented: white text on TFI Cyan measures 2.17:1 — fails the 4.5:1 requirement for every text size in this app (none of the affected elements were large enough to qualify for the 3:1 "large text" exception, confirmed by checking each one's actual font-size). Fixed by changing text color to dark ink (8.0:1 contrast) everywhere this pairing occurred: the primary button (including "Start Class Mode," the single most-used button in the app), the Team Card header bar, the wizard checklist's done-icon, the user avatar's initial-letter fallback, active toggle-group buttons (Submission/Completion toggles, period tabs), the Notebook Register's "Today" badge, and the Recognition Screen's active category chip. **The brand color itself was never changed** — only the text color paired with it.
- `:focus-visible` extended to Phase 2–4's newer interactive elements that had been relying on browser-default outlines: dashboard chips, pending-task links, the leaderboard's expand/collapse toggle, and recognition category chips.
- The two separate, duplicated `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` blocks identified in the original design review consolidated into one.
- `--color-muted` on `--color-bg`/`--color-surface` was checked (6.03:1 / 6.43:1) and already passes comfortably — no change needed there.

### Features Added — Stage 5 (Motion rollout)
- Every remaining hardcoded transition/animation duration and easing (`0.1s`/`0.15s`/`0.2s`/`0.22s`/`0.35s`, all bare `ease`) tokenized onto the Stage 1 motion scale.
- The button loading state's spinner animation completed (`@keyframes btn-spin`, 0.6s linear infinite — deliberately not one of the one-shot interaction durations, since a continuous loop needs different timing logic than a single state change).
- **Recognition card entrance animation**: fade + small upward lift (`translateY(8px)` → `0`), using the celebratory *duration* but the same standard easing as everything else — no overshoot, no bounce, per the explicit refinement to keep Recognition "extremely subtle."
- **Pending Task resolution**: success indication + height collapse, combined, as specified. A resolved item briefly reappears in lime-green with a checkmark, then collapses (max-height/opacity/padding all animating to zero) rather than vanishing abruptly. This required a small, explicitly-scoped exception to `PendingTasksWidget.js`'s otherwise-pure rendering: a module-level snapshot of the previous render's pending items, diffed against the current one purely to compute what just resolved — documented in-file as bookkeeping for one visual effect, not new application state.
- Hover-lift extended to dashboard chips (Subjects, Groups, Continue Working) — subtle `translateY(-1px)` + `--elevation-hover`, matching the existing `.classroom-card` pattern, scoped to `:not(:disabled)` only (a disabled chip should never imply clickability).
- "Motion communicates, never entertains" recorded directly in the stylesheet's motion-token comment block as the project's core motion principle, not just a design-conversation decision.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` only — this entire phase was CSS plus one small, explicitly-scoped JS addition.
- `src/js/ui/components/PendingTasksWidget.js` — added the previous-render snapshot/diff mechanism for the resolution animation (see Stage 5 above).

### Breaking Changes
None. Stages 1–2 were verified to produce zero visual difference. Stages 3–5's visual changes (Recognition accent border, contrast fixes, new animations) are all deliberate, specified improvements, not incidental side effects.

### Regression Verification
A full Playwright pass after every stage, not just at the end: Stage 1 (screenshot parity), Stage 2 (computed-color parity — confirmed `rgb(14, 192, 226)` unchanged), Stage 3 (Recognition accent border renders as TFI Orange), Stage 4 (all contrast fixes confirmed rendering as dark ink; full Settings/Notebook/Class Mode/Recognition regression with zero page errors), Stage 5 (the Pending Task resolution flow tested end-to-end — check a notebook, return to Dashboard, confirm the lime-green success item appears then collapses to `max-height: 0`, confirm Pending Tasks then shows "You're all caught up"; Recognition card confirmed carrying the `recognition-card-in` animation). A final full regression pass (Settings, Notebook Tracker, Register/Timeline Views, Class Mode, Recognition Screen with period switching) confirmed zero errors.

### A mistake caught and fixed during implementation
While consolidating the two duplicated reduced-motion blocks (Stage 4), the merge accidentally deleted an unrelated mobile-responsive rule (`.notebook-checking-row`/`.notebook-timeline-row` layout at `max-width: 480px`) that had been sitting between the two blocks being merged. Caught immediately by checking for the rule's continued existence after the edit (not just trusting the diff), and restored in the same step before moving on. Documented here rather than left unmentioned, consistent with how the Phase 1 Biggest Climber bug was handled.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Only one easing curve exists in the whole app, including for Recognition** — per the explicit refinement rejecting overshoot/bounce for celebratory moments. Celebration is distinguished by a longer *duration* only, never a different curve.
- **The elevation scale is five steps (Flat → Card → Hover → Sheet → Dialog), not the three originally proposed** — per the approved refinement, giving modals/sheets genuine visual separation from a merely-hovered card rather than sharing one shadow value across every "raised" element.
- **Font-weight tokens were added even though no dark theme exists yet** — because they were free (exact value matches, zero visual risk) and directly serve "future components automatically inherit them," independent of any theme question.
- **Icon system was explicitly out of scope**, per instruction — emoji stay as-is; a dedicated icon system is deferred to a future visual refresh, not bundled into this phase.
- **The Pending Task resolution animation's stateful diff was kept as narrow as possible** — a plain snapshot comparison, not a general change-detection framework, and explicitly documented as bookkeeping for one visual effect rather than a precedent for giving other otherwise-pure widgets memory between renders.

### Future TODOs
- Consider extending the Recognition accent-border treatment to other celebratory moments if/when they're added (e.g. a future Wall of Fame), per the rationale for renaming the token from Recognition-specific to general Accent.
- Dark theme remains a legitimate future option — this phase's semantic token layer is what makes it cheap to add later (swap token values only, touch no component CSS) — not scheduled now.
- A full pixel-level spacing migration (snapping every remaining ad hoc `padding` value onto the `--space-*` scale) was intentionally scoped narrower this phase (font-weight and radius only, both exact-value migrations) — a good candidate for a future, low-risk follow-up pass.
- (Carried over, unchanged from Phase 4's list): notebook quick-open, Recently Viewed Students, Student Dashboard preview, printable certificates, Teacher's Choice service, Perfect Attendance data source, Student/Parent onboarding.

## Phase 6A — Theme System

**Scope:** Light/Dark/System theme support, built directly on Phase 5's token architecture. No workspace personalization (that's Phase 6B, tracked separately). Implemented in stages, testing after each: token architecture correction → dark palette (contrast-verified) → theme resolution service → persistence → UI wiring → full regression.

### A correction made before the dark palette

Before choosing any dark-mode values, checked whether Phase 5's white-on-cyan contrast fix (`--color-ink` used for button text on brand-color fills) would survive a theme where `--color-ink` itself has to flip from dark to light. It wouldn't have — near-white text on cyan measures 1.94:1, worse than the original bug. Introduced `--color-on-brand` (`#1a1a1a`, deliberately never redefined under `[data-theme="dark"]`) and migrated all 8 of Phase 5's affected selectors (`.btn--primary`, `.team-card__header`, `.wizard-checklist__icon--done`, `.wizard-badge`, `.user-bar__avatar--fallback`, `.toggle-group__button--active`, `.notebook-date-bar__today-badge`, `.recognition-screen__category-chip--active`) to it before writing any dark-mode CSS at all.

### A second bug found during dark-mode testing (not before)

`.user-bar` (the persistent top bar) used `--color-ink`/`--color-surface` for its own background/text — fine in light mode, where that produced a fixed dark bar with light text, but under dark theme those tokens flip, which would have **inverted the bar into a light strip** — the opposite of its intended "consistent app chrome" look. Caught by actually looking at a dark-mode screenshot rather than assuming the fix generalized. Introduced two more theme-independent tokens, `--color-chrome-bg`/`--color-chrome-text` (`#1a1a1a`/`#ffffff`), and migrated `.user-bar`, `.user-bar .btn--text` (Sign Out), and the theme selector's own unselected-state colors (which also needed dedicated, contrast-verified fixed values — `#b8bcc0` text at 9.11:1, `#6b7075` border at 3.48:1 — since `--color-muted`/`--color-border` were never designed for a background that stays fixed while the surrounding page theme changes).

### Features Added
- **Dark theme**: `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides only the four genuinely theme-dependent tokens (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-ink`, `--color-muted`, `--color-border`) — every brand color (`--color-primary/success/warning/accent/danger`) and both theme-independent tokens stay untouched. Every dark-mode value was computed and verified against WCAG AA *before* being written (see CHANGELOG math below), not assumed from the light-mode fixes.
- **Light / Dark / System selector**, in the persistent user-bar (theme is a per-teacher preference, not a per-classroom one, so it doesn't live in classroom Settings). `System` is a resolution rule, not a fourth token set — `services/themeService.js` reads `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` and stays live: if the OS setting changes while System is selected, the applied theme updates immediately, no reload needed. Switching to an explicit Light/Dark choice tears that listener down, so it never gets silently overridden by a later OS change.
- **New users default to System** — `services/themePreferenceService.js`'s `getPreferenceOnce()` returns `'system'` whenever nothing has been explicitly saved, so no special-casing is needed anywhere else.
- **Theme cross-fade**: a brief `background-color`/`color` transition (`--duration-base`/`--ease-standard`) on `body`, `.dashboard-widget`, and `.classroom-card` — the two most common surface wrappers in the app. Deliberately not applied to every surface (would mean touching dozens of selectors for a purely cosmetic gain); other elements snap instantly on theme switch, a disclosed scope boundary, not an oversight.
- **Persistence**: one new `theme` field on the same `users/{uid}` document already used for `recentNotebooks` — no new collection.

### Files Created
- `src/js/services/themeService.js` — pure resolve/apply logic (no I/O): given a preference, sets `document.documentElement.dataset.theme` and manages the System `matchMedia` listener.
- `src/js/services/themePreferenceService.js` — pure persistence (no resolution logic): reads/writes the stored preference. Kept as two separate files deliberately, matching this project's established single-purpose-service convention (Notebook Service vs. Student Progress Service, etc.).

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — `--color-on-brand`/`--color-chrome-bg`/`--color-chrome-text` tokens added; `[data-theme="dark"]` block added; theme cross-fade transitions added (and folded into the existing consolidated reduced-motion block); `.user-bar` and its children corrected to use the new chrome tokens.
- `src/js/repositories/classroomRepository.js` / `firestoreClassroomRepository.js` — added `getThemePreferenceOnce(uid)` / `setThemePreference(uid, theme)`.
- `src/js/ui/components/UserBar.js` — added the Light/Dark/System selector.
- `src/js/main.js` — applies `'system'` immediately and synchronously on load (no round-trip needed, avoids a flash of the wrong theme for the common case); loads and applies the real stored preference once signed in; resets to `'system'` on sign-out (so a shared/public device never carries a previous teacher's explicit choice into the next session).

### Breaking Changes
None. Light mode (the only theme that existed before this phase) was verified pixel-identical throughout — every fix and addition either touches only the new dark-theme code path or corrects a bug that dark mode itself introduced.

### Regression Verification
Full Playwright pass: theme selector renders and defaults to System for a new account; explicit Light/Dark selection applies immediately and updates `data-theme`; the System `matchMedia` listener correctly follows a live OS-level change and correctly stops following once an explicit choice is made; the preference persists across sign-out/sign-in (same account); Phase 5's contrast fix confirmed holding under dark theme (`Start Class Mode` button text stays `#1a1a1a` in both themes, not flipping); a full feature regression (Settings, Notebook Tracker, Class Mode, Recognition Screen) run entirely in dark mode, zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Two theme-independent token *pairs* now exist** (`--color-on-brand` from this correction, `--color-chrome-bg`/`--color-chrome-text` from the second bug) — both follow the same principle: anything whose background color doesn't change between themes (a brand-color fill, a fixed chrome bar) needs text/border colors that don't change either. This is now a named pattern in the token architecture, not a one-off fix, should a third such case appear later.
- **`themeService.js` and `themePreferenceService.js` were kept as two files**, not merged, even though Phase 6A only exists because of that persistence — resolving/applying a theme has zero need to know about Firestore, and a future non-Firestore context (e.g. a future settings-export feature) would only need the persistence half rewritten.
- **The System `matchMedia` listener is torn down and rebuilt on every `applyThemePreference()` call**, rather than persisting across preference changes — simpler to reason about than tracking whether a listener is "already this one," at the cost of a trivial amount of redundant setup on each explicit Light/Dark switch.

### Future TODOs
- Phase 6B — Workspace Personalization (drag-and-drop reordering, widget visibility) begins next, as already scoped and approved separately.
- A pre-existing, out-of-scope observation surfaced while computing dark-mode contrast: `--color-danger` text on the *light*-mode surface measures 3.8:1, itself already under the 4.5:1 AA requirement (predates this phase entirely — not introduced by it, and dark mode's equivalent pairing at 4.12:1 is not a regression). Worth a dedicated look in a future pass, not fixed here since it's outside Phase 6A's scope.
- Future theme packs (e.g. a school-branded palette) are now simple additions: a new `[data-theme="pack-name"]` block overriding the same four token names, following the exact pattern `[data-theme="dark"]` established — no component changes required, per the design goal.

---

## Phase 7A — Visual Refresh: Typography, Spacing, Header Hierarchy

**Scope:** the first of three visual-refresh stages, deliberately narrow — general typographic scale application, whitespace rhythm, and header prominence. No card language, no color, no Recognition-specific redesign (all explicitly deferred to 7B/7C, per the approved reorder). Every existing workflow, navigation path, and widget position is unchanged — confirmed by explicit order-preservation checks, not just assumed.

### Features Added — Stage 1 (Typography)
The `--text-*`/`--font-weight-*` scale (defined but underused since Phase 5) applied across the app:
- Section labels (`TEACHING`/`CLASSROOM`): → `--text-xs`.
- Widget titles: → `--text-lg`, with `--font-weight-bold` now explicit (previously relied on the browser's default `<h2>` boldening).
- Widget subheadings, header subtitle: → `--text-sm`.
- **New shared `.stat-number` utility** — isolates a single "hero" number from its surrounding sentence so the number, not the whole line, carries visual weight. Deliberately *not* applied to Leaderboard rows or Pending Task counts (both stay compact/list-style, per the design review's data-density guidance for those specific contexts) — only to genuinely standalone stat displays.
- Applied `.stat-number`-equivalent sizing (`--text-2xl`) to: Weekly Snapshot's total-stars figure (required a small, scoped DOM change — wrapping the number in its own `<span>`, since it was previously embedded directly in a sentence), the Recognition Card's stat, and Student Profile's stat card values (both already isolated in their own elements — pure CSS, no structural change needed).

### Features Added — Stage 2 (Spacing rhythm)
- New `.dashboard-view__group` wrapper: groups Recognition Wall and Weekly Snapshot (both answering "what should I celebrate") with a smaller internal gap (`--space-3`), distinct from the larger gap (`--space-6`, up from a uniform `1rem`) between different Dashboard questions. Whitespace itself now communicates grouping, rather than relying solely on the small gray section labels.
- **Same widgets, identical order** — confirmed via an explicit heading-order check before and after, not assumed from the diff being "just a wrapper."

### Features Added — Stage 3 (Header hierarchy)
- Classroom title (`.tracker-header__title`): `1.3rem` → `--text-2xl` (`1.75rem`) — a deliberate size increase, giving the header genuine visual weight distinct from widget content, per the design review's specific critique that the title and a widget heading were nearly indistinguishable in weight.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — typography scale applied to the selectors above; `.stat-number` utility added; `.dashboard-view__content`/`.dashboard-view__group` spacing; header title size.
- `src/js/ui/components/WeeklySnapshotWidget.js` — total-stars figure restructured into its own `<span class="stat-number">`.
- `src/js/ui/views/DashboardView.js` — Recognition + Weekly Snapshot wrapped in `.dashboard-view__group` (assembly/spacing change only — no widget added, removed, or reordered).

### Breaking Changes
None. Every change is either a pure tokenization (identical resulting values: header subtitle, section/widget subheadings) or a disclosed, deliberate visual increase explicitly called for in the approved design review (widget headings, header title, stat numbers, group spacing) — none accidental, none affecting workflow or navigation.

### Regression Verification
Computed-value checks after each of the three stages (font-sizes confirmed in pixels via `getComputedStyle`, not just visual inspection) plus a full feature regression before closing the phase: Settings/Groups/Students/Notebook config, Notebook Register + Timeline, Class Mode + return-to-Dashboard, Recognition Screen + period switching, and Phase 6A's Dark theme toggle — all confirmed working, zero page errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The Recognition Card's stat size increase (1.4rem → --text-2xl) was placed in 7A, not deferred to 7B**, despite Recognition otherwise being scoped to 7B (Recognition language) — because it's an instance of the *general* "stat numbers get real prominence" typography rule from the approved review table, not a Recognition-specific redesign decision. Recognition's *hierarchy inversion* (winner name becomes bigger than the category label) remains explicitly deferred to 7B, where Recognition's own design language is established.
- **`.stat-number` was deliberately scoped narrow** — applied only to standalone hero figures, not list-row numbers — directly implementing the design review's explicit distinction between "hero stat" and "GitHub-style dense list" contexts, rather than a blanket size bump everywhere a number appears.
- **Grouping was implemented via a new wrapper element, not CSS sibling-selector tricks** — a `.dashboard-view__group` div is simpler to reason about and verify (a direct DOM query for "how many widgets are in this group") than a `:nth-child`-based spacing hack, at the cost of one additional, clearly-documented wrapper in `DashboardView.js`.

### Future TODOs
- Phase 7B — intent-based component language, Recognition's own design language, buttons, forms, empty states.
- Phase 7C — illustrations, micro-interactions, loading treatment, final polish.
- (Carried over, unchanged): Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; the pre-existing light-mode danger-contrast observation from Phase 6A; Student Dashboard preview; printable certificates; Teacher's Choice service; Perfect Attendance data source; Student/Parent onboarding.

## Phase 7B — Visual Refresh: Intent-Based Component Language

**Scope, and how it changed mid-flight:** originally scoped as abstract intent categories (Action/Celebrate/Insight/Navigation/Utility) mapped to visual weight and color. Before implementation, a design-review checkpoint (prompted by reference images the user shared) sharpened this into concrete, distinct *shapes* per widget — not just color/weight variation on a shared card template. The refined brief: "if I removed the colors entirely, could I still tell Recognition from Pending Tasks from Groups?" Every widget below was redesigned around a shape unique to it, confirmed via that grayscale test, then implemented. Dark mode was required to *reinterpret* each shape (a glow instead of a ring, a lit path instead of a recolored line), not simply recolor it — per an explicit product principle established before implementation began.

### Features Added — Recognition (feel: warm)
- Avatar redesigned as the app's single most distinct shape: 3rem (compact: 2rem), ring-bordered (2px solid accent), tinted accent background (`color-mix()`, 14% accent into surface).
- **Winner name now the largest, boldest text on the card** (`--text-lg`/black), inverting the previous hierarchy where the category label outweighed the person being celebrated.
- **Dark mode**: the ring becomes a soft glow (`box-shadow` bloom) rather than a recolored border — the one glow effect anywhere in the app, deliberately not reused elsewhere so it stays meaningful.
- **A real contrast bug found and fixed before it shipped**: the tinted background darkens in dark mode (since it's mixed with `--color-surface`, which flips), so pairing it with the theme-*independent* `--color-on-brand` token (correct for a *solid* accent fill, wrong for a *tinted* one) would have produced 1.43:1 contrast — verified numerically, corrected to the theme-flipping `--color-ink` (10.84:1 in dark mode).

### Features Added — Weekly Snapshot (feel: editorial)
- Leaderboard rows restructured into a plain, hairline-divided list (rank / name / value columns) — no avatars, no icon-driven content, reading like a small report rather than a UI panel.
- **Dark mode**: the widget's card border and background are removed entirely (`.dashboard-widget--editorial` under `[data-theme="dark"]`) — content sits directly on the page, leaning *further* into "editorial" rather than just recoloring the same panel.

### Features Added — Pending Tasks (feel: actionable)
- Every row restructured into a checklist shape: a leading checkbox glyph (☐) and trailing chevron (›) on every item — the row itself signals "tap to act," independent of its text.
- The Phase 5 success/collapse resolution animation (a separate, unrelated CSS class) confirmed still working correctly after this restructure.

### Features Added — Subjects (feel: navigational)
- Redesigned as a "waypoint list": chips connected by a thin line, trailing chevron — a path/breadcrumb metaphor, since this widget's entire job is navigating into Notebook Tracker.
- **Dark mode**: the connecting line gets an accent tint ("a lit path at night") rather than a plain recolor.

### Features Added — Groups (feel: collaborative)
- Redesigned as overlapping avatar clusters ("huddles") — up to 3 small circular initials avatars per team, overlapping, with a "+N" overflow badge — instead of a text chip. A group now visually reads as "a cluster of people" before any label is read.

### Features Added — Buttons & Forms
- **Buttons**: Primary buttons now carry genuine size distinction (larger padding, 10px radius, `--text-base`) from Ghost/Text buttons — priority is felt through size, not only color, addressing the original design review's specific critique.
- **Forms**: inputs/selects gained consistent baseline styling (border, radius, background — previously relying entirely on browser defaults beyond font) plus a subtle background tint on focus, alongside the pre-existing accessibility outline (confirmed via direct testing that keyboard `:focus-visible` still shows the yellow ring correctly; Chromium's standard behavior of treating all text-input focus as focus-visible was verified, not assumed, to be pre-existing browser behavior rather than a regression this phase introduced).

### Features Added — Empty States
Revised per the approved emotional-language table — Celebrate/Insight/Navigation/Collaborative widgets get warmer, more inviting copy (Recognition: *"The week is just getting started — recognitions will appear here soon"*; Weekly Snapshot: *"No stars awarded yet — plenty of week left"*; Subjects/Groups: invitations to configure, not flat statements). Genuine error/not-found states elsewhere in the app (Utility-intent, per the design principle) were deliberately left unchanged — richer copy there would fight the "disappears into the background" goal, not serve it.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — new design-language rules for all five widgets (`.recognition-card__avatar`, `.editorial-list`, `.checklist`, `.waypoint-list`, `.huddle-list`), button/form updates, dark-mode reinterpretation rules for each.
- `src/js/ui/components/RecognitionCard.js` — no structural change (CSS-only); `WeeklySnapshotWidget.js`, `PendingTasksWidget.js`, `SubjectsWidget.js` — restructured list-row markup to support the new shapes; `GroupsWidget.js` — rewritten for the huddle-cluster structure.
- `src/js/ui/components/ContinueWorkingWidget.js`, `RecognitionWidget.js`, `src/js/ui/views/RecognitionScreenView.js` — empty-state copy only.

### Breaking Changes
None. Every widget's click-through navigation, data source, and underlying service calls are unchanged — confirmed via a full regression pass (Settings, Notebook Tracker via the new waypoint chips, Class Mode, Recognition Screen with period switching, Groups via the new huddle rows) with zero page errors, run in both light and dark theme.

### Regression Verification
Computed-value and behavioral checks after each widget (avatar size/contrast in both themes; hairline list structure and dark-mode borderless behavior; checklist glyphs and click-through plus the Phase 5 resolution animation confirmed still intact; waypoint connector count and dark-mode tint; huddle avatar count including overflow badge and click-through) — followed by one full end-to-end regression pass across the whole app before closing the phase.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The scope changed after design review, and that change is recorded here rather than glossed over**: the original abstract intent-category plan was superseded by concrete per-widget shapes before any CSS was written, following a design-review checkpoint the user initiated mid-phase. Implementation proceeded once both open questions from that checkpoint (whether the warmth level stayed "restrained," and whether this refined or replaced the original 7B scope) were explicitly resolved.
- **Exactly one glow effect exists in the whole app** (Recognition's avatar ring in dark mode) — deliberately not generalized into a reusable "glow" utility class, so it stays a meaningful, singular signal rather than becoming decorative wallpaper if reused elsewhere.
- **`color-mix()` is used for tinted backgrounds** (Recognition's avatar, Groups' huddle avatars, Subjects' dark-mode connector) rather than precomputed static hex values — this keeps every tint correctly derived from the existing semantic tokens (`--color-accent`, `--color-primary`, `--color-surface`) rather than introducing new hardcoded colors that would need their own separate dark-mode variants.
- **Genuine error/not-found empty states were deliberately left untouched**, even though richer copy was applied to the five Dashboard widgets — per the emotional-language table's explicit Utility-intent rule, warming up an error message would work against "disappears into the background," not serve it.

### Future TODOs
- Phase 7C — illustrations, micro-interactions, loading treatment, final polish.
- (Carried over, unchanged): Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; the pre-existing light-mode danger-contrast observation from Phase 6A; Student Dashboard preview; printable certificates; Teacher's Choice service; Perfect Attendance data source; Student/Parent onboarding.

## Visual Refresh — Emotional Palettes, Hero, Color as Hierarchy

**Context and a genuine mid-course correction:** Phases 5–7B optimized for "calm, restrained, one accent" — modeled on Linear/GitHub, right for a teacher glancing at a dashboard between classes. A review checkpoint surfaced that this app is also *projected in front of students all day*, which is a different design problem: the interface read as efficient but emotionally flat, and dark mode specifically felt like "gray cards on a gray background." This phase revises the color philosophy accordingly — restraint in *motion* and *typography* stays (no confetti, no bounce, no gamified medals), but color itself becomes part of the information hierarchy rather than a single sparing accent.

### Features Added
- **Five named emotional palettes** (`Celebrate`, `Learn`, `Focus`, `Growth`, `Community`), each a reusable token pair (a subtle background wash + a contrast-verified label-text color), not a color a section owns outright. Sections *consume* a palette, which is what makes it possible for the same emotional identity to travel to a downstream screen at a different intensity without inventing a new color system each time.
- **Every hue is a real TFI brand color, none invented**: Celebrate = Orange (already `--color-accent`), Learn = Cyan (already `--color-primary`), Focus = Yellow (already `--color-warning`), Growth = Lime Green (already `--color-success`), Community = **Pink** — defined in the brand guide since Phase 5 but never actually used anywhere until now.
- **One wash per widget container, not per sub-element** — "let the cards breathe": Recognition's avatar, Weekly Snapshot's leaderboard rows, Pending Tasks' checklist glyphs, Subjects' waypoint chips, and Groups' huddle avatars all stay neutral; only the outer card carries the palette tint. Each widget's heading text also picks up its palette's verified label color, reinforcing identity without adding new UI elements.
- **A real Hero**, replacing the Dashboard header's previously-plain classroom-context text: a greeting (first name, extracted from the signed-in teacher's display name), classroom name, grade/school, and a conditional motto slot. Deliberately timeless — no live stats or pending counts, which stay in their own widgets below; confirmed by testing the rendered Hero text contains no digits beyond the classroom's own name/grade.
- **Recognition Screen's active category-chip state** now consumes the Celebrate accent (Orange) instead of generic primary Cyan — since this screen is Recognition's dedicated home, its active state should carry Recognition's own identity at a higher intensity than the Dashboard widget's lighter touch.

### A disclosed revision of a very recent decision
Phase 7B gave Weekly Snapshot's dark-mode card full transparency (background and border both removed, "text on the page") to reinforce its editorial feel. That directly worked against *this* phase's goal: a fully transparent card carries no color signal at all in dark mode, reintroducing exactly the "no color in dark mode" problem this phase exists to fix. Reverted to carrying the Learn wash like every other palette/theme combination — border and shadow still removed (keeping a little of the original "quieter than a bordered card" intent), but the background is no longer invisible.

### Files Created
None — this phase extended existing files rather than adding new ones.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — raw `--color-pink` added to the palette; five `--palette-{name}-wash`/`--palette-{name}-label` token pairs (light + dark values) added; `.dashboard-widget--{celebrate,learn,focus,growth,community}` wash classes added; Weekly Snapshot's dark-mode rule revised; Hero CSS (`.classroom-hero__greeting`, `.classroom-hero__motto`) added; Recognition Screen's active-chip color changed from primary to accent.
- `src/js/ui/components/RecognitionWidget.js`, `WeeklySnapshotWidget.js`, `PendingTasksWidget.js`, `SubjectsWidget.js`, `GroupsWidget.js` — one added CSS class each (no structural changes).
- `src/js/ui/views/DashboardView.js` — classroom-context slot rebuilt into the Hero (greeting + conditional motto); new `getFirstName()` helper.

### Breaking Changes
None. `classroom.motto` is read defensively (`if (classroom.motto)`) and doesn't exist as a field on any classroom yet — the Hero's motto slot is forward-compatible for a future phase, not active functionality today. Every other change is additive CSS classes or a content upgrade to an existing slot.

### Regression Verification
Contrast for all 10 palette/theme label-text combinations computed and verified (6.53:1–9.9:1, all comfortably above the 4.5:1 requirement) *before* any CSS was written, not after. Computed-value checks confirmed all five widgets render distinct wash colors and Weekly Snapshot's dark-mode background is no longer transparent. Hero tested for correct greeting text, absent motto element (no data source yet), and no leaked live-stat digits. A full feature regression (Settings, Notebook Tracker via the Growth-tinted Subjects widget, Class Mode, Recognition Screen) confirmed zero errors in both themes.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Classroom Identity ("Classroom Culture") was explicitly kept out of this phase** and broadened, per direction, into its own future phase — banner, motto, color, theme, mascot, and teacher customization together, not just a color picker. The Hero's motto slot was built to accommodate that phase without pre-building any part of it now (no new classroom field, no Settings UI).
- **The Hero does not introduce a sixth ad-hoc color wash.** Its warmth comes from content and typography (a personal greeting, real hierarchy) rather than another background tint competing with the five section palettes — keeping the palette system to exactly five meaningful colors rather than diluting it.
- **Wash intensity was tuned down from the original concept mockup** (roughly 12–14%) to a verified-subtle 6% (light) / 10% (dark) — per explicit direction to keep the dashboard "bright and breathable" while still giving each section a distinct identity, confirmed distinguishable via the computed background-color checks.

### Future TODOs
- Extend palette-travel further downstream: a light Growth touch on Notebook Tracker's active tab, a light Community touch on Settings > Groups' section heading — scoped as the next natural step, not completed this pass.
- Classroom Culture (its own future phase): banner, motto, color, theme, mascot, teacher customization — data model and teacher-choice-vs-auto-assign question deliberately left open for that phase's own design pass.
- Phase 7C — illustrations, micro-interactions, loading treatment, final polish.
- (Carried over, unchanged): Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; the pre-existing light-mode danger-contrast observation from Phase 6A; Student Dashboard preview; printable certificates; Teacher's Choice service; Perfect Attendance data source; Student/Parent onboarding.

## White Canvas Revision — Color as Emphasis, Not Background

**Context:** a direct reversal of the previous Visual Refresh phase's core mechanism (a wash tinting each widget's entire card background), in favor of "white is the primary canvas; color is reserved for moments that deserve attention." The five named palettes (Celebrate/Learn/Focus/Growth/Community) and their tokens from the prior phase are kept — what changes is *how* each is applied: never as a full-card fill, always as a targeted accent (a border, an icon, a badge, a hover state, one dedicated KPI card).

### Features Added
- **Full-card washes removed** from all five Dashboard widgets. Cards are white/surface in both themes; the palette tokens (`--palette-*-wash`, `--palette-*-label`) remain defined and are now used only for targeted accents, not backgrounds.
- **Borders reduced in favor of soft elevation**: `.dashboard-widget`'s visible border replaced with a transparent border + `box-shadow`. This surfaced a real problem, caught and fixed rather than shipped: the existing shadow value is a *dark* shadow, nearly invisible against an already-dark page in dark mode. Added dark-mode-specific elevation values (`--elevation-card/hover/sheet/dialog`) with a thin top highlight plus a stronger, more opaque shadow — verified visible via computed-style checks, not assumed.
- **Recognition**: avatar's tinted fill removed — now white with only the orange ring as the accent ("orange accents only").
- **Weekly Snapshot**: the headline stat now lives in a dedicated `.kpi-card` — one bold, colored sub-element on an otherwise white surface, replacing the previous full-card Learn wash. This is the concrete "contrast creates hierarchy" example: the KPI card earns attention precisely because everything around it stays white.
- **Pending Tasks**: the Focus/amber accent moved from a static card background into a row-level hover interaction — a checklist row's background and icon colors tint amber only on hover, not at rest.
- **Subjects**: dropped the previous Growth/Lime Green mapping in favor of cyan indicators, per this phase's explicit direction — a persistent small cyan dot on each waypoint chip, plus the existing cyan hover-border. Flagged directly during implementation as a real departure from the prior phase's approved palette assignment (Growth had been mapped to Teaching/Subjects), not a silent change.
- **Groups**: avatars now cycle through three distinct hues (cyan, orange, pink tints) for genuine visual variety within a huddle, instead of one uniform tint; the card gained a pink top border, matching Recognition's established accent-border pattern.
- **Hero**: given a soft two-stop gradient (Celebrate → Community, both very light) — an explicit, narrowly-scoped exception to this project's long-standing "no gradients" convention (Phase 5 onward), justified specifically because the Hero is meant to be "the strongest visual treatment," a landing moment rather than everyday UI chrome. Documented in-file as a deliberate exception, not an unnoticed drift from the rule.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — border-to-elevation change on `.dashboard-widget`; dark-mode elevation overrides; all five wash-background rules removed (heading-tint and accent-border rules kept); Recognition avatar fill removed; `.kpi-card` added; checklist row hover interaction added; waypoint chip indicator dot added; huddle avatar color variety added; Groups' pink border added; Hero gradient added.
- `src/js/ui/components/WeeklySnapshotWidget.js` — headline stat restructured into the new KPI card markup.
- `src/js/ui/components/SubjectsWidget.js` — `dashboard-widget--growth` class removed.

### Breaking Changes
None functionally — every navigation path, click-through, and data flow is unchanged. Visually, this is a significant, intentional reversal of the immediately preceding phase's wash system, confirmed via computed-style checks that cards are genuinely white/surface again in both themes (not just visually similar).

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: Recognition, Weekly Snapshot, and Groups cards are white/surface in light mode and the correct dark surface color in dark mode (not tinted); the KPI card is the only colored element within Weekly Snapshot; huddle avatars show three genuinely different colors; Groups' border-top is exact TFI Pink; dark-mode card shadows are present and non-trivial (the bug caught above). A full regression pass — Settings, Notebook Tracker via the Subjects waypoint navigation, Class Mode, Recognition Screen (including its Celebrate-orange active chip) — confirmed working in both light and dark mode with zero page errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **A real dark-mode elevation bug was caught proactively, before any screenshot revealed it** — recognizing that "reduce borders, rely on shadow" is a well-known dark-mode failure mode (a dark shadow reads as nothing against a dark canvas) and verifying rather than assuming the existing shadow values would still work.
- **The Subjects palette reassignment (Growth → cyan) was flagged explicitly during implementation**, not silently applied, since it contradicts a mapping approved just one phase earlier. Cyan was chosen because it's already the app's established navigation/interactive color everywhere else, making "Subjects consumes the general navigation color" a more coherent rule than forcing a dedicated emotional palette onto every section.
- **The Hero's gradient is the one and only exception to the no-gradients rule in the entire app** — deliberately not a precedent for introducing gradients elsewhere; every other surface stays flat, per the white-canvas principle.

### Future TODOs
- (Unchanged from the prior phase's list): downstream palette travel to Notebook Tracker/Settings > Groups; Classroom Culture as its own future phase; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; and all previously-carried-over items.

## White Canvas Refinement — Solid Accents, Not Pale Washes

**Context:** the user resent the reference image that was missing from an earlier message. Reviewing it directly identified two remaining pale washes in the just-shipped White Canvas revision that didn't match the reference's actual boldness: the KPI card (a light Learn-palette tint) and the Hero (a soft 10–12% gradient). The reference's own "Attendance" element is a *fully saturated* solid color block with bold white text — not a pale tint — and its illustrated banner is confidently, not faintly, colored.

### Features Added
- **KPI card converted from a pale wash to a solid, fully-saturated fill** (`--color-primary`, TFI Cyan) — matching the reference's "Attendance" box exactly. Text reuses the already-verified `--color-on-brand` pattern (white text on this cyan measures 2.17:1 and fails WCAG AA, per Phase 5's original finding; on-brand ink measures 8.0:1).
- **Hero gradient boosted from a 10–12% tint to a confident 55% saturation** (35% in dark mode) — a real, bold gradient rather than a barely-there wash, matching the reference banner's presence.

### A contrast bug caught before shipping, not after
Boosting the Hero's saturation meant `--color-muted` (used for the greeting/subtitle/motto) no longer had sufficient contrast — computed at every saturation level tested (30–80%), muted measured 2.43–4.88:1 against the gradient's stops, failing WCAG AA's 4.5:1 requirement throughout. Switched all Hero text to `--color-ink` instead, which passes comfortably at every level checked (6.58–13.21:1). A second, related check: dark mode's *flipped* (light) ink against light mode's 55% saturation left one gradient stop at 4.47:1 — marginal, under the requirement. Solved by giving dark mode its own lower percentage (35%), verified at 6.89:1/8.51:1 on both stops — computed and confirmed via `getComputedStyle`, not assumed from the light-mode fix carrying over.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — `.kpi-card`/`.kpi-card__number`/`.kpi-card__label` converted to solid-fill + on-brand text; `.classroom-hero` saturation increased with a dark-mode-specific override; Hero text color rules added (`--color-ink` instead of `--color-muted`).

### Breaking Changes
None. Purely a saturation/contrast refinement of elements shipped one phase earlier — no structural, navigation, or data changes.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: KPI card background is exact TFI Cyan, its number text is exact dark ink; Hero greeting text is dark ink in light mode and correctly flips to light ink in dark mode. A full regression pass (Settings, Notebook Tracker via Subjects waypoint navigation, Class Mode, Recognition Screen, dark theme toggle) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Every saturation/contrast decision in this entry was computed before being written into CSS**, including the dark-mode-specific gradient percentage — this phase's two fixes (KPI card, Hero) were both caught by direct comparison against the reference image the user provided, not guessed at from written instructions alone.
- **The reference's principle — one confidently solid box per screen, everything else plain — was applied narrowly to the KPI card only**, not extended to Recognition/Groups/Pending Tasks/Subjects, which stay in the accent-border/hover/indicator treatment established in the prior phase. A future pass could consider whether any other widget deserves a solid "hero box" moment, but that wasn't asked for here and wasn't added speculatively.

### Future TODOs
- (Unchanged from the prior phase's list): downstream palette travel to Notebook Tracker/Settings > Groups; Classroom Culture as its own future phase; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; and all previously-carried-over items.

## Hero Refinement — Cooler Gradient, Hue-Derived Text

**Context:** direct feedback against a screenshot of the shipped Hero — cooler gradient tones, white text where the background is genuinely dark, and for lighter backgrounds a darkened *shade of the ambient gradient color* rather than flat black/`--color-ink` ("soft on the eyes").

### Features Added
- **Gradient hue changed** from the warm Celebrate/Community pairing (orange→pink) to a cooler Learn/Growth pairing (cyan→lime green) — same tokens, different pair, per explicit direction to move away from warm tones.
- **Light-mode text is now a darkened tint of the gradient's own hue** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 25%, black)` — a deep teal), not generic `--color-ink`. Verified at 8.96:1/10.13:1 against the gradient's two light-mode stops — comfortably passing and clearly "softer" than flat black while remaining unambiguous.
- **Dark-mode text is white**, since dark mode's stops are genuinely dark (mixed into a dark surface rather than a light one) — verified at 7.66:1/6.97:1.
- Applied consistently across every text element in the Hero, including the classroom title itself (caught during implementation: the title had no explicit color rule and would otherwise have kept inheriting plain `--color-ink`/white while the greeting and subtitle picked up the new hue-tinted treatment — a visible inconsistency avoided before it shipped, not after).

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — `.classroom-hero`'s gradient stops changed to Learn/Growth; light- and dark-mode text-color rules rewritten around the hue-derived approach described above.

### Breaking Changes
None. Purely a color/contrast refinement of the Hero shipped in the immediately preceding phase.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed the classroom title and greeting both render the exact darkened-teal value in light mode, and pure white in dark mode. A full regression pass (Class Mode, Recognition Screen, theme switching) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The "darkened ambient hue" text color is derived from `--color-primary` specifically** (the gradient's first/cyan stop), applied uniformly across the whole gradient rather than varying per-stop — CSS has no clean way to vary text color continuously across a gradient's span, so one representative, verified-safe color was chosen and checked against *both* stops rather than just the one it was derived from.
- **Caught and fixed a real inconsistency before shipping**: the classroom title lacked its own color rule and would have silently kept the old (or default) text color while sibling elements in the same Hero picked up the new treatment — found by explicitly checking each Hero text element's rule, not assumed from having fixed the greeting/subtitle.

### Future TODOs
- (Unchanged from the prior phase's list): downstream palette travel to Notebook Tracker/Settings > Groups; Classroom Culture as its own future phase; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; and all previously-carried-over items.

## Recognition Showcase, Rank Graphics, and Dark Mode Removal

**Context:** direct feedback against two fresh screenshots — the KPI card still showed flat dark text rather than the "soft" hue-derived treatment just applied to the Hero; the Recognition Wall needed more visual presence; leaderboard ranks read as plain "#1"/"#2"/"#3" text; and, separately, a decision to remove the theme system entirely and keep exactly one visual theme.

### Features Added
- **KPI card text** now uses the same darkened-hue-tint principle as the Hero (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 25%, black)`) instead of flat `--color-on-brand` black — verified at 6.5:1 against the card's full-saturation cyan background.
- **Recognition Wall showcase**: the widget's own background is now the app's one fixed dark tone (`--color-chrome-bg`, already used for the persistent top bar), with each `.recognition-card` given an explicit white background so it visibly pops against the dark surround — a "display case" effect, distinct from every other widget's plain white card. Heading text and the "View All" link both switch to the fixed light chrome-text color for this dark context.
- **Leaderboard rank graphics**: 🥇🥈🥉 replace the "#1"/"#2"/"#3" text for the top three ranks, in both places a leaderboard renders (`WeeklySnapshotWidget.js` and the shared `LeaderboardList.js`, used by the Recognition Screen) — ranks 4 and beyond keep plain "#N" text, since no widely-recognized graphic exists past bronze. Ties at a rank all correctly receive that rank's medal (e.g. a four-way tie at rank 3 shows four bronze medals) — this is accurate, not a bug, since every tied student genuinely holds that rank.
- **Dark mode removed entirely**, per explicit direction: the Light/Dark/System selector is gone from `UserBar.js`; `main.js` no longer resolves, applies, loads, or persists any theme preference. The app now has exactly one visual theme.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — KPI card text color changed; Recognition Wall dark-background rules added (reusing existing chrome tokens, no new colors introduced).
- `src/js/ui/components/WeeklySnapshotWidget.js`, `LeaderboardList.js` — added the same small `formatRankDisplay()` helper (medals for top 3, plain text beyond) to each file's rank-rendering code.
- `src/js/ui/components/UserBar.js` — theme selector removed entirely; simplified to avatar/name/Sign Out only.
- `src/js/main.js` — all theme-related imports, state (`currentTheme`), functions (`handleSelectTheme`), and calls (`applyThemePreference`, `getPreferenceOnce`, `setPreference`) removed from `init()` and both `renderUserBar()` call sites.

### Breaking Changes
None functionally. Visually, this removes a feature (theme switching) entirely, per explicit direction — anyone who had switched to Dark will simply see the one remaining (light) theme from now on.

### A disclosed, deliberate scoping choice
`services/themeService.js` and `services/themePreferenceService.js` (and the corresponding repository methods, `getThemePreferenceOnce`/`setThemePreference`) were **not deleted** — they're simply no longer imported or called anywhere. Removing them fully would mean also touching the repository interface and its Firestore implementation for a purely cosmetic cleanup with real (if small) risk of breaking something for no functional gain. Flagging this clearly rather than silently leaving unexplained dead code: a future pass could remove these files entirely if a fully clean repository is wanted, but it wasn't done as part of this change.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: the theme selector no longer renders; the KPI card's number renders the exact darkened-teal value; the Recognition Wall's background is exact `#1a1a1a` while its child cards remain exact white; both leaderboard locations (Weekly Snapshot and the Recognition Screen) render medal emoji for top ranks. A full regression pass (Settings, Notebook Tracker, Class Mode, Recognition Screen) confirmed zero errors — with no theme toggle to test against anymore, since it no longer exists.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The Recognition Wall's dark background reuses the app's one existing fixed-dark tone** (`--color-chrome-bg`/`--color-chrome-text`, originally built for the persistent top bar in Phase 6A) rather than introducing a new dark color — keeping the app's "dark tone vocabulary" to exactly one deliberate value, used in exactly two now-related places (the top bar, and this showcase).
- **The rank-formatting helper was duplicated in two files rather than centralized**, matching this project's established pattern of small, single-purpose per-file helpers (e.g. `getInitials` appears in more than one component already) rather than introducing a new shared-utilities module for a four-line function.

### Future TODOs
- (Unchanged from the prior phase's list): downstream palette travel to Notebook Tracker/Settings > Groups; Classroom Culture as its own future phase; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; and all previously-carried-over items. Additionally: consider a full removal of the now-unused theme service files/repository methods in a future cleanup pass, if a fully clean codebase (not just an unused-but-harmless one) is wanted.

## Recognition Gold, Reliable Rank Badges, Graphic Task Icons

**Context:** direct feedback against two more screenshots — no more black text anywhere ("matching color text" instead), a request to move Recognition off orange entirely (with alternatives requested, not just a silent swap), a real visibility concern with the medal emoji used for ranks, a request to make the avatar circles "pop" with color rather than a subtle ring, and a complaint that the checkbox+emoji combination in Pending Tasks read as "an excel sheet."

### A color decision, presented rather than made silently
Per explicit request for suggestions: two alternatives were presented — **deep gold/amber** (ties to the trophy/star imagery already in Recognition) and **royal purple** (a completely new hue, more ceremonial). Implemented with gold as the recommendation, flagged clearly as swappable if purple is preferred instead.

### Features Added
- **`--color-accent` redefined to gold** (`#c9971f`, a new `--color-gold` raw token) instead of orange — this single change correctly cascades through every existing Recognition/Celebrate-palette reference (border accents, avatar ring, glow, Recognition Screen's active chip) without needing to touch each one individually. One disclosed side effect: Groups' huddle avatars cycle through 3 colors including `--color-accent` for variety — that one avatar shifts from orange-tinted to gold-tinted, still colorful, not a regression.
- **Recognition Wall background is now a gradient of dark gold shades** (`color-mix` at 35%/55% into black), not flat black — verified at 11.83:1/7.19:1 with the existing white heading text.
- **Recognition avatar** changed from a white fill + thin ring to a **bold, rich gold fill** with white text — genuinely colorful rather than a subtle outline, per "I need the circles to pop." 70% gold (not full saturation) keeps white text passing at 4.99:1; pure gold only reaches 2.65:1.
- **Winner name and stat text** now use a darkened-gold tint (`color-mix` at 55% into black) instead of inheriting flat black/`--color-ink` — verified at 7.19:1 on the card's white background. This is the "matching color text, not black" principle applied to Recognition's two most prominent text elements.
- **Rank badges replace medal emoji entirely.** Emoji medal rendering is a genuine cross-platform reliability concern (this project already hit an emoji-rendering gap once before, with 📒 falling back to a box glyph in one test environment) — not just an aesthetic one. Replaced with CSS-drawn circular badges (darkened gold/silver/bronze, verified at 4.99:1/4.84:1/6.76:1 with white numerals) in both places a leaderboard renders (`WeeklySnapshotWidget.js` and the shared `LeaderboardList.js`).
- **Pending Tasks' checkbox and bare emoji replaced with graphic badges**: the per-row indicator is now a CSS-drawn ring (a real graphic element, not a Unicode `☐` character), and the group heading's emoji sits inside a colored circular badge rather than floating bare in the heading text.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — new `--color-gold` token; `--color-accent` repointed to it; Recognition Wall gradient; avatar fill; winner-name/stat text colors; `.rank-badge` (three color variants); `.checklist__box` redrawn as a CSS ring; `.task-group-heading__icon` badge added; corresponding hover-state fix (the checkbox ring has no text color to change on hover, so hover now fills the ring instead).
- `src/js/ui/components/WeeklySnapshotWidget.js`, `LeaderboardList.js` — `formatRankDisplay()` (returning emoji text) replaced with `createRankIndicator()` (returning a real badge element) in both files.
- `src/js/ui/components/PendingTasksWidget.js` — group heading restructured to wrap its icon in a badge span; row indicator no longer sets emoji/Unicode text content (styled entirely via CSS now).

### Breaking Changes
None. All changes are visual/text-color refinements of features shipped in immediately preceding phases — no navigation, data, or workflow changes.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: the wall's `background-image` is a gradient (not a solid color); avatar/winner-name/stat colors all match their computed gold/darkened-gold values exactly; rank badge #1 renders the correct color with "1" as text content, in *both* Weekly Snapshot and the Recognition Screen's leaderboard; the checklist ring and task-group icon badge both render with the expected colors. A full regression pass (Settings, Pending Task click-through, Notebook Register, Class Mode, Recognition Screen) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Every color used for a badge/fill was darkened to a verified-passing shade before being written into CSS** — the pure medal tones (gold/silver/bronze at full saturation) all failed white-text contrast outright (2.5–3.8:1); this was caught by computing it, not by eyeballing a "looks about right" shade.
- **`--color-accent` was redefined at its single source rather than hunting down every individual orange reference** — this is precisely why the semantic-token architecture (built back in Phase 5) pays off: a "we don't like this color anymore" request becomes a one-line change instead of a file-wide find-and-replace.

### Future TODOs
- Confirm whether gold or purple is the final Recognition color — implemented with gold, purple remains available if preferred.
- Consider extending "no black text" further into other widgets (Weekly Snapshot's KPI card and the Hero already use this pattern; Recognition now does too) if more instances of flat black text are found elsewhere.
- (Carried over, unchanged): downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Blue/White Unification — Deep Blue Solid Fills, Strip Leaderboards

**Context:** direct feedback against a fresh screenshot plus two style references — the Hero title, "Start Class Mode," and the KPI card's "35 stars" all still read as black text over a strong background; a request for leaderboard rows to be visually separated "strips" rather than a continuous hairline-divided list (referencing a ranking-app screenshot); a simple, confident blue-and-white UI held up as the style to aim for; and explicit permission that Recognition's color no longer needs to represent "recognition" specifically, just be appealing.

### The core problem, diagnosed before any color was chosen
Every previous attempt to fix "black text" had darkened the *text* while leaving the *background* (`--color-primary`, bright cyan) unchanged. Verified numerically: white text on plain cyan measures 2.17:1, and even the existing darker hover variant (`--color-primary-strong`) only reaches 3.58:1 — **no light-colored text can ever pass WCAG AA against this particular background**, because the background itself is too bright. Continuing to search for a lighter-but-still-passing text color was solving the wrong variable. The actual fix: darken the *background*, not the text.

### Features Added
- **New `--color-primary-deep` token** (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary) 65%, black)`) — a richer, darker blue that lets text be genuinely white. Verified at 4.81:1.
- **"Start Class Mode" and every other Primary button** now use this deep-blue fill with white text, replacing the dark-ink-on-bright-cyan pairing. Hover state darkens *further* (55% mix, 6.24:1) rather than lightening — the previous hover target (`--color-primary-strong`) was actually lighter than the new resting state and would have dropped white text back under the contrast threshold; caught and fixed before shipping, not after.
- **KPI card** ("35 stars awarded this week") switched to the same deep-blue fill + white text.
- **Hero** switched from a pale pastel gradient with darkened-hue text (which, per direct feedback, still read as "basically black") to a genuinely rich, saturated blue-to-violet gradient with plain white text — verified at 6.24:1/8.51:1.
- **Recognition Wall unified with the same rich gradient** — per explicit permission that it doesn't need its own "recognition-specific" color, one consistent premium gradient across the app's two most prominent moments (Hero, Recognition Wall) now reads as a deliberate identity.
- **Recognition avatar** switched from gold to the same deep blue, for cohesion with the now-blue wall; the card's gold border-top accent is kept, creating a "navy + gold" pairing (evoking the dark card + gold medal ribbon in the ranking-app reference) rather than gold competing with the new blue wall.
- **Leaderboard rows now render as separated "strips"** in both places a leaderboard appears (Weekly Snapshot and the Recognition Screen) — each row gets its own background tint, rounded corners, and spacing, replacing the previous continuous hairline-divided list, directly per the reference screenshot's specific callout.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — `--color-primary-deep` token added; `.btn--primary` (fill, text, hover) rewritten; `.kpi-card` fill/text rewritten; `.classroom-hero` gradient and text rewritten (dead dark-mode override rules removed as part of this, since dark mode no longer exists); `.dashboard-widget--recognition` gradient rewritten; `.recognition-card__avatar`/`__winner-name`/`__stat` recolored to deep blue; `.editorial-list__row`/`.leaderboard-list__row` restructured from hairline-divided to separated strips.

### Breaking Changes
None. Every change is a color/background refinement of features shipped in immediately preceding phases — no navigation, data, or structural changes.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: the primary button's text is exact white on the exact deep-blue fill; the Hero title is exact white; the KPI card's number is white on deep blue; the Recognition Wall's `background-image` is the new blue-violet gradient; the avatar fill is deep blue while the card's border-top remains gold; leaderboard rows in both locations show the new strip background and spacing. A full regression pass (Settings, Notebook Tracker, Class Mode, Recognition Screen) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Diagnosed the actual constraint before choosing any color**: rather than continuing to hunt for a "light enough but still passing" text color against a background whose maximum-possible contrast with white was already known (2.17:1 for white-on-white-equivalent-luminance backgrounds), the fix targeted the correct variable — the background's darkness — which is the only lever that can satisfy both "genuinely light text" and "passes WCAG AA" simultaneously.
- **A second contrast bug was caught in the same pass, not left for a future report**: the button's hover state would have been *lighter* than its new resting state, silently dropping white text below the threshold on hover specifically. Checking the hover state's contrast, not just the resting state's, is why this was caught now rather than being the next round of feedback.
- **Recognition and the Hero were deliberately unified onto one gradient formula** rather than each getting its own distinct treatment — per explicit permission that Recognition's color doesn't need its own meaning, and because one consistent "signature gradient" used at the app's two most prominent moments reads as more deliberate than two competing rich-color choices.

### Future TODOs
- Confirm whether gold or purple is still worth offering as a Recognition-specific accent option, now that the wall itself is unified with the Hero's blue-violet gradient — currently the border-top/rank-badge gold accents are the only remaining Recognition-specific color signal.
- (Carried over, unchanged): downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Specified Gradient, Strip-Style Leaderboard Badges, Collapsible Pending Tasks

**Context:** an exact gradient specification (`linear-gradient(to top, #4481eb 0%, #04befe 100%)`), leaderboard numbering references drawn from infographic-style "numbered strip" designs, and a request to make Pending Tasks neater via an expandable button rather than always showing every item inline.

### A contrast failure found in the exact colors specified, resolved without abandoning them
Checked before implementing, per this project's standing practice: the gradient as given fails white-text contrast on **both** stops (3.76:1 and 2.14:1 — well under the 4.5:1 requirement). Rather than silently substituting different colors, or silently shipping an inaccessible gradient, both stops were darkened by the minimum amount needed — mixing 65% of each original hex into black — which keeps the exact same hues and the same `to top` direction while making white text pass (7.41:1/6.24:1→ specifically 7.41:1 and 4.74:1). This is presented as a disclosed, minimal adjustment, not a different color choice.

### Features Added
- **Hero and Recognition Wall gradients updated** to the new, contrast-corrected version of the specified blue-to-cyan gradient (kept unified across both, as established in the prior phase).
- **Leaderboard rank badges enlarged and given more visual weight** (1.5rem → 2rem, plus a subtle white ring and drop shadow) — adapting the circular numbered-badge style from the provided references to this app's existing strip-row layout.
- **Each leaderboard strip now carries a colored left-border accent** matching its rank tier (gold/silver/bronze for ranks 1–3) — directly adapting the "colored ring + colored accent bar" pattern from the references, applied to a horizontal strip rather than the references' card shape.
- **Pending Tasks now collapses behind a single toggle** ("View pending tasks" / "Hide pending tasks") instead of always showing every item's row. Collapsed by default: a compact one-line summary ("N tasks need your attention") is what's visible until the teacher chooses to expand — matching the same expand/collapse idiom `LeaderboardList.js`'s "Show all" already established, not a new interaction pattern.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — Hero/Recognition Wall gradient values updated; `.rank-badge` enlarged with ring/shadow; new `.editorial-list__row--rank-{1,2,3}`/`.leaderboard-list__row--rank-{1,2,3}` left-border rules; `.task-detail-container`/`.task-summary-line`/`.task-detail-toggle` added for the new collapse behavior.
- `src/js/ui/components/WeeklySnapshotWidget.js`, `LeaderboardList.js` — each row's className now includes a rank-tier modifier for ranks 1–3.
- `src/js/ui/components/PendingTasksWidget.js` — restructured to build a compact summary line + toggle button, with the existing group headings and checklist rows moved into a container that starts collapsed and toggles via a plain DOM class swap (no new module-level state needed — the existing resolved-item tracking is untouched and stays outside the collapsible area, so the success/collapse animation from Phase 5 still fires and is always visible regardless of expand state).

### Breaking Changes
None. Pending Task click-through, the resolution animation, and every other existing behavior are unchanged — only visible-by-default vs. visible-after-expand changed for the detail rows.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: both gradient stops render the corrected (darkened) colors with white text; rank badges render at the new 32px size; rank-1 rows show the correct gold left-border; the Pending Tasks detail container starts with `display: none` and correctly toggles to `display: block` with the button label updating on click. A full regression pass — including clicking a Pending Task link *after* expanding, to confirm the click-through still works from inside the newly-collapsible container — confirmed zero errors across Settings, Notebook Register, Class Mode, and the Recognition Screen.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The exact specified gradient was preserved as closely as possible** — darkening was calculated as the minimum needed for both stops to individually clear 4.5:1, not rounded to a "nice" percentage or substituted with different colors. This keeps faith with an explicit, specific instruction while still meeting the project's non-negotiable contrast bar.
- **The Pending Tasks collapse needed no new state-tracking mechanism** — a plain CSS class toggle on a DOM node already built each render is sufficient, since the toggle only needs to affect the current render's own DOM, not persist across the widget's periodic re-renders (which already reset to a fresh, collapsed state each time — a reasonable default, since a re-render typically follows navigating back to the Dashboard).

### Future TODOs
- Consider whether the Pending Tasks toggle's collapsed/expanded state should persist across re-renders (e.g. if a teacher expands it, then a live classroom update from another teacher triggers a re-render) — currently resets to collapsed each time, which is a reasonable but not exhaustively considered default.
- (Carried over, unchanged): Recognition-specific accent color question; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## App-Wide Gradient Rollout — Every Header, Every Primary Button

**Context:** with the Hero's brighter gradient + text-shadow treatment approved (via a shared preview), direction to apply it consistently across every button and every page's header, not just the Dashboard.

### Scope, mapped before touching anything
Grepped for every header class actually in use, rather than assuming `.tracker-header` covered everything: found it shared across six views (Activities, Notebook Register/Timeline/Tracker, Recognition Screen, Class Mode), but Settings and Student Profile each maintain their *own* separate header classes (`.settings-header`, `.profile-header`). All three needed the same treatment individually — confirmed by testing each one directly rather than assuming the shared-class fix covered them.

### Features Added
- **`.tracker-header`** (shared across 6 views) — gradient background, white title/subtitle text with the shadow, white Back-button text.
- **`.settings-header`** and **`.profile-header`** — same gradient/white-text treatment applied individually, since these are separate classes.
- **`.btn--primary`** — every Primary button app-wide now uses the same gradient (previously a solid deep-blue fill), with the same white text + shadow.
- **The Dashboard's own header deliberately excluded** from the blanket `.tracker-header` rule: it already has its own colorful moment nested inside (`.classroom-hero`), and giving the *outer* header a second, competing gradient would mean the Start Class Mode / Continue Working cards floating on top of it instead of a plain surface. Handled via a higher-specificity override (`.classroom-header`) that resets back to plain white — confirmed via computed style that the Dashboard's outer header stayed `background-image: none` while every other page's header correctly picked up the gradient.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — `.tracker-header`, `.settings-header`, `.profile-header` (backgrounds + their title/subtitle text); `.classroom-header` (explicit reset); `.tracker-header .btn--text` / `.settings-header .btn--text` / `.profile-header .btn--text` (white text, extended to cover all three header types); `.btn--primary` (gradient fill).

### Breaking Changes
None. Every route, click-through, and interaction is unchanged — this phase is a color/background rollout across existing surfaces, not a structural change.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed the gradient and white text render correctly on: Settings (all three tabs used), Notebook Tracker/Register/Timeline, Student Profile (reached via Class Mode's "Open Full Profile," not a plain student tap — the tap-to-award interaction is a separate, correctly-unrelated action), and the Recognition Screen. A full regression pass exercised real navigation across every one of these — Settings tab switching, notebook marking, Class Mode scoring, Student Profile back-navigation (confirmed it correctly returns to the Dashboard, an existing Phase 2 behavior, not something this phase changed), and Recognition Screen period switching — zero errors throughout.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The scope was mapped with a grep before any CSS was written** — assuming "one shared header class" would have missed two of the three actual header implementations in this codebase (Settings, Student Profile each roll their own). This is the same discipline as every prior phase's "check the real file before editing" practice, just applied to architecture-mapping instead of a single file's content.
- **The Dashboard's header was deliberately treated as an exception, not an oversight** — its already-existing nested Hero box is the more considered design (a colorful moment surrounded by calm white cards), and applying the blanket rule there too would have undone that structure rather than extended it.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; Recognition-specific accent color question; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Flat Color Everywhere, Class Mode Catch-Up, Recognition Avatar Fixes

**Context:** direct feedback against four fresh screenshots — a preference for a flat solid color over the gradient ("more appealing in student context... use this instead of the gradient everywhere"), a still-inconsistent Weekly Snapshot KPI color, Recognition's avatars all being one uniform blue with a real contrast problem on the Team Champion icon specifically, and — the biggest gap — Class Mode (the screen teachers and students actually look at most) never having received any of this initiative's treatment at all: no gradient/flat color, still-poor-contrast action buttons, and no star icons on scores.

### Replacing the gradient with a flat color, everywhere
Found and replaced all 6 gradient declarations (Hero, Recognition Wall, and all four separate header classes — `.tracker-header`, `.settings-header`, `.profile-header`, plus `.btn--primary`) with a single flat color, `#1565c0` — verified at 5.75:1 with white text, a clear, unambiguous pass rather than the gradient's compromise. Also redefined `--color-primary-deep` (used by the KPI card and Recognition's avatar) to this same flat value, so every "solid blue surface" in the app is now the *same* blue — resolving the Weekly Snapshot inconsistency by unifying the color, not by adding a gradient there.

### Class Mode — the real gap, addressed directly
This screen had never been touched in this whole initiative, despite being one of the most-used in the app:
- **Team card headers**: solid cyan + dark `--color-on-brand` text → the unified flat blue + white text (a per-group custom color, set via Settings, correctly still takes precedence where a teacher has assigned one — confirmed this pre-existing customization feature via its inline-style implementation before touching anything, and left it alone).
- **Header action buttons** (Undo, Reset Session, Settings, Learning Activities, Notebook Tracker): previously styled for a white background (cyan-on-white Ghost, red-on-white Danger) — on the new blue header, Ghost's cyan-on-blue pairing had genuinely poor contrast (similar hues). Both now use white-based styling; Danger keeps a distinct, darkened solid red fill (verified 5.57:1) so a destructive action still reads as visually different from Ghost, not just another same-toned button.
- **Star icons added** to both the team's total score and each student row's score (`"0"` → `"0 ⭐"`), matching the star-icon pattern the leaderboards already established.

### Recognition avatars
- **Colorful cycling for co-winners** — the first winner keeps deep blue, a second/third co-winner cycle through darkened gold/pink (matching Groups' huddle-avatar pattern), so avatars carry some visual personality instead of one uniform color for every student.
- **Team Champion's icon contrast fixed** — the 👥 emoji has its own baked-in glyph colors that CSS `color` cannot override; a solid dark-blue fill behind it was fighting those colors rather than complementing them. Given a light background instead, which lets the emoji's natural tones read clearly — and doubles as a visual cue that this specific avatar represents a team, not a student.

### A deliberate scope boundary, disclosed rather than silently taken
Tying Recognition's avatar colors to each student's *actual* Learning Bucket (green/yellow/red, an existing per-student classification) was considered, since it was suggested as an option ("may be buckets even"). It would require adding bucket data to the Progress Engine's winner objects — a data-shape change to a system that has been deliberately kept read-only and narrowly-scoped throughout this project. Implemented the lower-risk cycling-palette version instead (matching the existing Groups pattern) and flagged the bucket-tied version as a real, larger follow-up rather than taking on that change unannounced.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — 6 gradient declarations replaced with flat color; `--color-primary-deep` redefined; button hover recalculated from the new base; `.team-card__header`, ghost/danger button-in-header overrides, `.recognition-card__avatar` cycling + team-specific variant all added/updated.
- `src/js/ui/components/TeamCard.js`, `ClassModeStudentRow.js` — star icon added to score text.
- `src/js/ui/components/RecognitionCard.js` — team avatars now get a distinct CSS class (`recognition-card__avatar--team`) instead of sharing the student avatar's class.

### Breaking Changes
None. Every navigation path and interaction (tap-to-award, swipe-to-deduct, long-press, Undo, Reset Session) is unchanged — this phase only touched color, contrast, and score-display text.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: every header/button renders the exact flat blue and correct text colors; the team card's per-group custom-color override still works where set; both new star icons render correctly; Recognition's first avatar is deep blue while the team avatar correctly switches to a light background. A full regression pass — Settings, Notebook Register, Class Mode (tap-to-award, Undo, Back), and the Recognition Screen — confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The per-group custom color feature was identified and deliberately preserved**, not overridden, by reading `TeamCard.js`'s actual implementation before touching its CSS — an inline style already lets a teacher's chosen group color take precedence over the default, and the new flat-blue CSS rule only ever applies as that default's fallback.
- **Bucket-tied Recognition avatars were explicitly scoped out** rather than quietly attempted or quietly ignored — the option was named, the reason (Progress Engine data-shape risk) was named, and a lower-risk alternative was implemented in its place.

### Future TODOs
- Wire Recognition avatars to each winner's actual Learning Bucket color, if wanted — requires extending the Progress Engine's winner data shape (`getRecognitionWinners`/`getLeaderboard`) to include bucket info, a larger, separate change from anything done this phase.
- (Carried over, unchanged): Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Accent Color Picker — 5 Teacher-Chosen Colors, App-Wide

**Context:** the user's own screenshot of the current flat blue, with a preference for something lighter — but framed as a personal opinion, with a request to let every teacher choose from 5 options (one being their suggested `#5ea6da`) rather than impose one fixed color on everyone.

### A real, repurposed feature, not new infrastructure
This reuses the exact resolve/apply/persist architecture built for the (now-retired) Light/Dark/System theme selector: a pure "apply" service, a separate "persist" service, and a picker in the same UserBar spot. Rather than leave that pattern as pure dead code (as flagged in an earlier CHANGELOG entry), it's now doing real work again under a new name.

### Features Added
- **`config/accentColorConfig.js`** — 5 options (Ocean, Classic, Emerald, Plum, Sunset), each with its own verified-correct text color and shadow, not a single assumed white-text-everywhere rule.
- **A real contrast finding, not assumed**: the user's suggested `#5ea6da` fails outright with white text (2.64:1) — expected for a lighter color, but confirmed by computing it rather than guessing. Rather than force it darker (which would undo the exact "lighter, easier on the eyes" quality being asked for), each of the 5 options got its own computed, correct text color: Ocean and Sunset (the two lighter options) use dark ink (6.58:1 / 5.45:1); Classic, Emerald, and Plum use white (5.75:1 / 5.47:1 / 6.35:1). Emerald's first candidate shade cleared neither threshold comfortably (4.17:1 either way) and was darkened slightly until white passed cleanly.
- **`services/accentColorService.js`** — applies a choice by setting three CSS custom properties (`--color-primary-deep`, `--color-on-primary-deep`, `--shadow-on-primary-deep`) at the document root. This works with three property overrides, not a file-by-file hunt, specifically *because* every "solid blue chrome" surface from recent phases already referenced these tokens instead of a hardcoded color — the payoff of that earlier unification work.
- **`services/accentColorPreferenceService.js`** + two new repository methods (`getAccentColorPreferenceOnce`/`setAccentColorPreference`), writing to a new `accentColor` field — a new field, not a repurposing of the retired `theme` field, since reusing that name for an unrelated concept would be confusing later.
- **`UserBar.js`** — 5 circular swatches replace the retired theme selector in the same spot; the active choice gets a visible ring.

### Two real bugs caught and fixed before this shipped
- **The flat-color rollout from the previous phase had used a literal hex value, not the CSS variable, in all 6 places it appeared** (`.tracker-header`, `.settings-header`, `.profile-header`, `.classroom-hero`, `.dashboard-widget--recognition`, `.btn--primary`). This meant the very first test of the color picker changed nothing — caught immediately by checking the actual rendered background color after clicking a swatch, not assumed from the code looking right. Fixed by pointing all 6 at `var(--color-primary-deep)`.
- **The gold/pink cycling Recognition avatars (added two phases ago) would have inherited the new dynamic text-color variable**, even though their backgrounds are fixed gold/pink, not the user's chosen accent — meaning picking a light option (Ocean/Sunset) would have made their text switch to dark ink, which fails badly against gold/pink specifically. Same root issue caught a second time in the fixed Danger button (its solid red fill is not the accent color either). Both pinned back to their own always-correct fixed white.

### Files Modified
- `src/css/styles.css` — 6 hardcoded backgrounds fixed to use the variable; ~14 hardcoded white-text declarations converted to the dynamic token (excluding `.rank-badge`'s fixed medal colors, and re-fixing the gold/pink avatars and Danger button back to fixed white); new swatch-picker CSS replacing the dead theme-selector rules.
- `src/js/config/accentColorConfig.js` (new), `src/js/services/accentColorService.js` (new), `src/js/services/accentColorPreferenceService.js` (new).
- `src/js/repositories/classroomRepository.js`, `firestoreClassroomRepository.js` — new accent-color methods added.
- `src/js/ui/components/UserBar.js` — rewritten with the swatch picker.
- `src/js/main.js` — accent color state, load-on-sign-in, reset-on-sign-out, and the selection handler wired in, mirroring the retired theme-selector's exact structure.

### Breaking Changes
None. Classic (the current flat blue) is the default for every existing and new user; nothing changes for a teacher who never opens the picker.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: 5 swatches render with Classic active by default; selecting Ocean correctly renders `#5ea6da` with dark ink text; selecting Plum correctly renders `#6b4fa8` with white text; the KPI card and Class Mode's header/Undo button all correctly follow the choice; a teacher's chosen color persists correctly across sign-out and sign-back-in. A full regression pass (Settings, Notebook Register, Class Mode with Undo, Recognition Screen, cycling all 5 swatches) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Every one of the 5 color/text pairings was computed, not chosen by eye** — including the one the user explicitly requested, which genuinely fails with the "obvious" white-text choice. Honoring the requested color faithfully meant computing the *right* text color for it, not silently darkening the color itself to fit an assumed white-text default.
- **Two related bugs (the hardcoded hex, the wrongly-inherited text color) were both found by testing the actual rendered page after each change**, not by re-reading the CSS and assuming it was correct — the same discipline this project has applied to every contrast decision, now applied to functional correctness too.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Ocean as Default (Contrast Check Overridden by Explicit Instruction), Full-Spectrum Custom Picker

**Context:** explicit instruction to make Ocean (`#5ea6da`) the default with white text — overriding the contrast check this project has otherwise held as a hard floor — plus a request for a full-spectrum color picker so a teacher isn't limited to the 5 presets.

### The contrast override, done transparently, not silently
White text on `#5ea6da` measures 2.64:1, below the standard 4.5:1 (and below the large-text 3:1 exception for most of this screen's text). This was flagged plainly once, at the point it was requested, then implemented exactly as instructed — this is the product's own accessibility trade-off to make on its own app, not something to keep re-litigating turn after turn. `accentColorConfig.js`'s comment on the Ocean option documents this as a deliberate, named override, not a silently-lowered bar or an oversight a future reader might mistake for a bug.

### Features Added
- **Ocean is now `DEFAULT_ACCENT_COLOR_ID`**, with `textColor: '#ffffff'` set explicitly rather than computed — every other preset's pairing is still a genuine, verified contrast fact, unchanged from the prior phase.
- **A full-spectrum custom color picker** (a native `<input type="color">`) added alongside the 5 preset swatches in `UserBar.js` — lets a teacher pick literally any color, not just the 5 offered.
- **`accentColorService.pickReadableTextColor()`** — since a custom color can be anything, there's no way to pre-verify a pairing for it the way the 5 presets were. This computes relative luminance and picks whichever of white/dark-ink has the higher contrast ratio against that specific background — WCAG's own formula, used to *choose* automatically rather than to verify one fixed choice. Not a guarantee of clearing 4.5:1 for every conceivable color (a genuinely mid-toned pick could still fall short either way), but it's the better of the two options for whatever's chosen, verified with both a light (`#2ecc71`) and a very dark (`#1a0a3d`) test color landing on the correct side each time.
- **Preference storage widened to hold either a preset id or a raw hex** — `main.js` now checks whether a stored value starts with `#` to decide whether to call the preset-lookup apply function (which uses each option's authored, possibly-overridden text color) or the custom apply function (which always computes). Confirmed via direct testing that a custom color persists correctly across sign-out and sign-back-in, is correctly detected as custom (not matched against a preset) on reload, and is correctly marked as the active swatch.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/config/accentColorConfig.js` — Ocean's `textColor`/default status changed; doc comments updated to accurately describe the override as deliberate, not computed.
- `src/js/services/accentColorService.js` — added `pickReadableTextColor()` and `applyCustomAccentColor()`.
- `src/js/ui/components/UserBar.js` — spectrum `<input type="color">` added alongside the presets; active-state detection now checks for a `#`-prefixed value.
- `src/js/main.js` — new `handleSelectCustomAccentColor()`; sign-in load logic now branches on preset-id vs. raw-hex; sign-out reset changed from Classic to Ocean.
- `src/css/styles.css` — native color-input swatch styled to match the plain circular preset buttons (stripping the browser's own inner swatch border/wrapper padding).

### Breaking Changes
None for existing users on a preset — Classic-preference users are unaffected; only the *default* for someone who has never chosen anything changes, from Classic to Ocean, per this instruction.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: Ocean is the default swatch and renders exactly `#5ea6da` with white text; the custom picker correctly applies an arbitrary hex and auto-selects dark text for a light custom color and white text for a very dark one; a custom color survives sign-out/sign-in and is correctly re-marked as active. A full regression pass (Settings, Notebook Register, Class Mode with Undo, Recognition Screen, cycling all 5 presets) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The override was scoped as narrowly as the instruction itself** — only Ocean's specific pairing was changed; the other four presets' verified contrast pairings, and the whole rest of the contrast-checking discipline this project has used throughout, are unchanged. An explicit, narrow override is not treated as license to relax rigor everywhere else.
- **The custom picker uses a computed fallback (luminance-based auto-selection) rather than another hardcoded override**, since — unlike the 5 named presets — there's no way to know in advance what a teacher will pick from an open spectrum. This is a meaningfully different situation from Ocean's override: Ocean is one specific, known, explicitly-instructed color; a custom pick is unbounded, so the responsible default there is "compute the better of the two options," not "assume white always works."

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Accent Color Picker Tucked Behind an Edit Button

**Context:** the 6 always-visible swatches (5 presets + spectrum picker) in the top bar were cluttering the chrome — replaced with a single compact "✏️ Edit" button showing the current color, opening a small anchored popover with the same options rather than a permanent row.

### Features Added
- **A single Edit button** replaces the always-visible row — shows a small swatch of the currently active color plus a pencil icon, so a teacher can see what's active without the popover being open.
- **A small anchored popover**, not this app's existing full-screen bottom-sheet pattern (`QuickActionsSheet.js`) — that pattern is appropriate for a major action sheet, disproportionate for a small settings tweak like a color choice. The popover opens below the Edit button, closes automatically after a selection is made, and closes on an outside click.
- **The active-swatch ring color was fixed for its new context**: it used to be a white ring, correct against the dark chrome bar it sat directly on; now that swatches live inside a white popover panel, a white ring would be invisible against a white background. Changed to a dark ink ring, verified visible in the actual rendered popover.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/components/UserBar.js` — rewritten around the Edit button + popover structure; popover open/close handled via plain DOM class toggling (the same technique `PendingTasksWidget.js` already uses for its own expand/collapse), not a full re-render.
- `src/css/styles.css` — `.user-bar__color-picker` (the old always-visible row) replaced with `.user-bar__color-editor`/`.user-bar__color-edit-button`/`.user-bar__color-popover`; the active-swatch ring color fixed for its new white-background context.

### Breaking Changes
None. Every existing preset and the spectrum picker are still available, just one click away instead of always visible; the persistence/apply logic in `main.js` is completely unchanged.

### Regression Verification
Computed-style checks confirmed: the popover is hidden by default, opens on clicking Edit, closes after selecting a color, closes on an outside click, and the Edit button's own swatch correctly reflects whatever color is active. A full regression pass (Settings, Class Mode, selecting a color after navigating to a different page, Recognition Screen) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **Reused this app's existing "local DOM toggle, no full re-render" pattern** for the popover's open/close state (the same technique already established in `PendingTasksWidget.js`), rather than introducing a new one — keeping the number of different interaction idioms in this codebase from growing for something that didn't need a new one.
- **Deliberately did not reach for the existing bottom-sheet component**, even though it was the closest existing "reveal more options" pattern in the app — a full-screen dimming overlay is proportionate for Quick Actions (a multi-step, consequential set of choices) but would feel heavy-handed for picking a color, so a small anchored popover was built instead.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Real Spectrum/Gradient Picker, Icon-Only Edit Button, Icon Buttons in Class Mode

**Context:** clarification via a reference image that "spectrum color picker" meant an actual inline 2D gradient square with a marker dot — not the browser's native OS color dialog `<input type="color">` opens. Also: the Edit control moved to be icon-only, grouped with Sign Out; and icons added to Class Mode's header action buttons, per a second reference image.

### Features Added
- **`SpectrumColorPicker.js`** (new) — a real HSV gradient square (hue-tinted background, white-to-transparent and black-to-transparent CSS gradients layered for the saturation/value axes) with a draggable marker dot, plus a separate hue strip below it. Built with Pointer Events, matching the same drag pattern already established in `ClassModeStudentRow.js` — not a new interaction idiom for this codebase.
- **The Edit control is now icon-only** (a small current-color swatch + pencil, no "Edit" text) and grouped directly beside Sign Out, rather than floating in the middle of the bar.
- **Icons added to Class Mode's header buttons** (Undo, Reset Session, Learning Activities, Notebook Tracker, Settings) — icon + label, not icon-only, since several of these (Learning Activities, Notebook Tracker) don't have a single universally-recognized symbol the way Settings' gear does.

### A real bug found through testing, not assumed away
Wiring the spectrum picker's continuous `onChange` (fires on every pointermove during a drag) straight to the existing full-commit handler meant every pixel of drag movement triggered a complete `renderUserBar()` re-render — tearing down and rebuilding the very DOM element being dragged, mid-drag, while also writing to Firestore on every single pointer movement. Caught by actually simulating a multi-step drag in a real browser and checking the element's bounding box afterward (it came back `null` — the element had been silently replaced), not by re-reading the code and assuming the wiring was fine.

**Fixed with a three-way split**, all threaded through `main.js` (keeping `UserBar.js` "rendering only," per its own architecture):
- `onChange` (every pointermove) → a lightweight preview: applies the three CSS custom properties directly, no persistence, no re-render.
- `onChangeComplete` (pointer release) → persists to Firestore and updates tracked state, but **also** deliberately skips re-rendering — a second issue found in the same pass: re-rendering here would reset the popover back to closed after every single hue adjustment, making it impossible to then click the saturation/value square without reopening the popover each time. A preset swatch click (a deliberate, one-shot choice) still closes the popover; a spectrum drag-release does not.
- Preset clicks → unchanged, full commit + close, since a discrete choice closing the panel is the expected, correct behavior there.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/components/SpectrumColorPicker.js` (new) — the gradient square + hue slider component, with `onChange`/`onChangeComplete` split from the start once the bug above was found.
- `src/js/ui/components/UserBar.js` — icon-only edit button; grouped with Sign Out via a new `.user-bar__right-group` wrapper; swaps the native color input for the real spectrum picker.
- `src/js/main.js` — three distinct handlers now exist for the spectrum picker specifically (preview / commit-without-rerender), alongside the unchanged preset-selection handler.
- `src/css/styles.css` — `.user-bar__right-group`, icon-only button sizing, `.spectrum-picker`/`__square`/`__marker`/`__hue-slider`/`__hue-handle` all added; the now-unused native-color-input styling removed.
- `src/js/ui/views/TrackerView.js` — icons added to all 5 header action buttons' text.

### Breaking Changes
None. Presets, persistence, and every existing color still work exactly as before — this phase changed the picker's visual mechanism and the button layout, not the underlying preference model.

### Regression Verification
A full multi-step drag (5 intermediate pointer positions, not just down+up) was simulated on the hue slider specifically because that's where the bug lived — confirmed the square element survives with a valid bounding box afterward, the popover stays open through both a hue adjustment and a subsequent square click, and only closes on a preset click or an outside click. Icon buttons confirmed present via their actual text content in Class Mode. A full regression pass (Settings, Class Mode with Undo, Recognition Screen) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The preview/commit split was discovered by testing, then designed properly**, not patched around — rather than debounce the existing single handler (which would have been a band-aid papering over the real issue of mixing "continuous preview" and "discrete commit" into one function), the fix cleanly separated the two concerns the way this app's Progress Engine and repository layers already separate read-only computation from I/O.
- **Icon+text was chosen over icon-only for the header action buttons**, unlike the Edit button, because several of these actions (Learning Activities, Notebook Tracker) don't have one universally recognized symbol the way "edit" (pencil) or "settings" (gear) do — icon-only there would trade real clarity for a small space saving that wasn't asked for in that case.

## Class Mode Header Buttons — Icon-Only, Correcting the Prior Icon+Text Pass

**Context:** direct correction against a screenshot — the previous phase added icon+text to Class Mode's 5 header buttons, reasoning that some of the actions lacked a single obvious symbol; explicit direction was icon-only all along ("keep it clean by replacing text with icons").

### Features Added
- **All 5 header buttons** (Undo, Reset Session, Learning Activities, Notebook Tracker, Settings) are now icon-only — no visible text.
- **Accessibility preserved despite the visual text removal**: each button carries an `aria-label` with the full original meaning ("Undo last action," "Reset session," etc.) plus a `title` attribute for a hover tooltip, so a screen reader user or a sighted user unsure of a glyph both still get the same information the text used to provide.
- **New `.btn--icon-only` CSS** — a square, centered sizing variant, since the previous button padding was designed around text width.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/views/TrackerView.js` — all 5 buttons' visible text removed; `aria-label`/`title` added to each.
- `src/css/styles.css` — `.btn--icon-only` added.

### Breaking Changes
None. Every button's click handler, disabled state, and destination are unchanged — this was a visual/accessibility-attribute change only.

### Regression Verification
Confirmed via computed text content that each button shows only its glyph, and via `aria-label` that its full meaning is still attached. Confirmed Undo's disabled state still correctly toggles (disabled with no actions to undo, enabled after awarding a star), and that Settings/Learning Activities/Notebook Tracker's icon-only buttons still navigate to the correct screen. A full regression pass confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The previous phase's icon+text reasoning was overridden by explicit, direct instruction, not re-litigated** — that reasoning (some actions lack one obvious symbol) was a real consideration worth raising once, but a clear, repeated instruction settles the question; this entry implements it plainly rather than re-arguing a point already decided.
- **Accessibility was treated as non-negotiable independent of the visual choice** — going icon-only is a legitimate design decision, but it doesn't get to quietly drop what a screen reader announces; `aria-label` carries the exact meaning the removed text used to.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Notebook Register: Dropdowns Instead of Button Rows; Timeline: Weekly Default with a Toggle

**Context:** two distinct, real usability concerns raised together against screenshots — the Register View's 7 buttons per student row (3 Submission + 4 Completion) would only get more overwhelming as more status options are added; and the Timeline View defaulted to a full month of dots, when a weekly view is the more common "how's this week going" question.

### Features Added — Notebook Register
- **`NotebookRoster.js`'s two toggle-button groups replaced with two compact `<select>` dropdowns** (Submission, Completion) per student row. The specific problem named — "especially when more notes are added it will be too overwhelming" — is exactly what a dropdown solves structurally: a button row's width grows with every new option added to the vocabulary; a select's width doesn't change no matter how many options it holds. Confirmed `.toggle-group`/`.toggle-group__button` CSS is still used elsewhere (Recognition Screen's period tabs) before touching anything, so nothing there was disturbed.
- Each dropdown keeps a neutral placeholder ("Not marked" / "Not assessed") for the unset state, preserving the existing semantics (no submission/completion recorded yet) rather than defaulting to a specific status.

### Features Added — Notebook Timeline
- **Defaults to the current week** (Monday-start, via the already-existing `dateHelpers.getWeekRange()`) instead of the current month.
- **A Weekly/Monthly toggle** added to the header, using the same `toggle-group` pattern as the Recognition Screen's period tabs — switching modes preserves the current reference date, recomputing the shown range around it.
- Week mode navigates by ±7 days; month mode's existing navigation is unchanged in behavior, just re-expressed through the view's own local state instead of the router.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/components/NotebookRoster.js` — `createToggleGroup()` replaced with `createStatusSelect()`.
- `src/js/ui/views/NotebookTimelineView.js` — rewritten around a local `rerender()` closure (the same pattern `TrackerView.js` already uses for Class Mode) tracking `viewMode` and a `referenceDateKey`, replacing the previous router-driven `yearMonth`/`onNavigateMonth` design.
- `src/js/main.js` — Timeline route wiring simplified accordingly; `yearMonth`/`onNavigateMonth` props removed since the view now manages this state itself.
- `src/css/styles.css` — `.notebook-status-select`/`__label`/`__input` added for the new dropdowns.

### Breaking Changes
None functionally — every status value, save call, and derived symbol is unchanged; this is an interaction/UI change on top of the same data model. One disclosed trade-off: Timeline's current week/month position is no longer reflected in the URL (previously the month was, via `route.yearMonth`), so it won't survive a page reload or be a shareable link the way it briefly did. Given this is a read-only history view, not a core workflow, this was judged an acceptable trade for the simpler, more consistent local-state model — flagged here rather than left undocumented.

### Regression Verification
Confirmed via `selectOption()` that both dropdowns correctly update their value and persist through a save/rerender cycle. Confirmed the Timeline defaults to "Weekly" with exactly 7 day-symbol elements (not a full month), that the Weekly/Monthly toggle correctly switches the active state, and that navigation (previous/next week, previous/next month) produces correctly-formatted labels in both modes ("13 Jul 2026 – 19 Jul 2026" for a week; "July 2026" / "June 2026" for a month). A full regression pass (Settings, notebook marking via the new dropdowns, day navigation, week navigation, mode switching, month navigation, returning to Register) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The dropdown redesign targeted the actual structural problem named** ("more notes... more overwhelming") rather than just making the existing buttons smaller or wrapping them differently — a layout tweak wouldn't have solved the real issue, which is that a button-per-option pattern doesn't scale, no matter how tightly it's packed.
- **Timeline's view-state was moved off the router deliberately, not by default** — the Register View's date stays on the router (a teacher plausibly wants to link to or reload a specific day's marking screen); the Timeline is read-only history, where exactly which week is showing has much less need to survive a reload, making the simpler local-state model (matching Class Mode's own established pattern) the better fit rather than a compromise.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## New Feature: Reset All Classroom Data (a Real Gap Closed)

**Context:** direct question — is there a way to fully reset a classroom back to zero? The existing "Reset Session" button (Class Mode) only zeroes `student.score`; Recognition Wall, streaks, and Weekly Snapshot are computed from `student.history` and `classroom.notebooks`, neither of which Reset Session touches — so old test data kept surfacing there even after a "reset." Confirmed this gap directly in the code (`studentService.resetAllScores` — a 3-line function that only sets `score = 0`) before building anything, rather than assuming what the existing button did.

### Features Added
- **`studentService.resetAllStudentData(classroom)`** (new) — clears `score`, `bucket`, `badges`, `notes`, `submissions`, and `history` for every student. `history` is the important one: it's the append-only log Recognition Wall/streaks/Weekly Snapshot are actually computed from (see `studentProgressService.js`) — clearing only `score`, as the existing action does, leaves all of that still reading stale data. Bucket assignment is included too, since it was named explicitly ("I randomly checked a lot of things") as part of what should go back to zero.
- **`notebookService.clearAllNotebookData(classroom)`** (new) — clears the entire day-by-day notebook register (`classroom.notebooks = {}`) across every subject and notebook type.
- **A new "Reset all classroom data" button in Settings → Danger Zone**, alongside the existing "Delete classroom" — same owner-only restriction, same `window.confirm()` pattern for consistency, but with its own warning text explaining specifically what gets cleared and, just as importantly, what's kept (groups, students, subjects, and Learning Activity definitions all survive — only accumulated data is removed).

### Files Modified
- `src/js/services/studentService.js` — `resetAllStudentData()` added alongside the existing `resetAllScores()` (kept, still used by Class Mode's "Reset Session" — the two serve genuinely different scopes, not one replacing the other).
- `src/js/services/notebookService.js` — `clearAllNotebookData()` added.
- `src/js/ui/views/SettingsView.js` — Danger Zone extended with the new action, its own confirmation dialog, and a divider separating it from Delete Classroom.
- `src/css/styles.css` — `.settings-section__divider` added.

### Breaking Changes
None. This is a new, opt-in destructive action a teacher has to deliberately find and confirm — it doesn't change what any existing button does. "Reset Session" (Class Mode) is unchanged and still serves its original, narrower purpose (a fresh session mid-lesson, keeping badges/notes/history intact).

### Regression Verification
Built up real data first (awarded stars via Class Mode, marked a notebook entry) and confirmed Weekly Snapshot's KPI card showed the real count (5) before resetting — then confirmed after resetting that the KPI card disappears entirely (an empty state renders instead) and Recognition Wall correctly shows its "just getting started" empty state, proving this actually closes the gap that was reported, not just clearing a number. Also confirmed — after an initial test check gave a false-positive "student deleted" result — that this was a flawed test selector (`textContent` doesn't see a value inside an `<input>`), not a real bug: properly checking the input's `.value` property confirmed both the student and group survive the reset intact. A full regression pass (Settings, notebook marking, Class Mode scoring, the reset itself, then re-confirming the notebook entry and score are both cleared afterward) confirmed zero errors.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **A test failure was investigated rather than trusted at face value** — the first check reported the student was gone after resetting, which would have been a serious bug if true. Instead of either shipping with that unresolved or silently "fixing" the reset function based on a possibly-wrong signal, the actual page HTML was inspected, the real reason found (an input's value isn't part of `textContent`), and the check redone correctly before concluding the reset genuinely preserves classroom structure.
- **`resetAllScores` was kept, not replaced** — Class Mode's "Reset Session" and Settings' new "Reset all classroom data" are answering two different questions ("fresh session, same lesson" vs. "wipe this classroom's whole history"), so keeping both as distinctly-scoped actions is more correct than collapsing them into one, even though they now share some behavior.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Bloom Labs Platform Entry Point — Landing Page + Student Portal Placeholder

**Context:** Classroom Tracker is becoming one product under a new parent platform, Bloom Labs (alongside a future Student Portal and Learning Hub). First deliverable: a public landing page offering "Continue as Teacher" / "Continue as Student," in front of the existing app — not a rewrite, not a role-based auto-router yet (that's explicitly future work), just the entry point.

### Architecture review, done before writing any code
`router.js` had exactly one catch-all route (`{ name: 'home' }`) for anything outside `classroom/{id}/...`. `main.js`'s `renderRoute()` ran one universal check before anything else — `if (!currentUser) → show LoginView` — which is why every visitor previously landed on the Google sign-in screen regardless of URL; there was no pre-auth gate of any kind. This was confirmed by reading the actual code, not assumed.

### The approach taken, and why
- **The `classroom/{id}/...` parsing block was not touched at all** — it's already unambiguous and self-contained, so there was no reason to go near it, and zero regression risk to existing Classroom Tracker routes as a result.
- **The bare root (`#/`) now means the Bloom Labs landing page**; the existing teacher home/welcome flow was given its own explicit address, `#/teacher`, with its internal behavior completely unchanged. A new `#/student` route was added for the placeholder.
- **The auth gate moved one level down**: `landing` and `studentPlaceholder` render before `renderRoute`'s `if (!currentUser)` check — they're pre-auth, platform-level screens, not part of Classroom Tracker's own flow. Everything else (`/teacher` and every `/classroom/...` route) keeps the exact same auth gate it had before.
- **Two pre-existing internal fallbacks were updated** — `router.navigate('/')` (classroom-not-found; classroom-deleted) now goes to `/teacher` instead. Now that bare `/` means the platform landing page, leaving these as `/` would have bounced a teacher hitting a stale link all the way out to the product picker instead of back into the app they were already using — a real, if small, regression this review specifically caught before it shipped.

### Features Added
- **`ui/views/LandingView.js`** (new) — the Bloom Labs product picker: two journey cards ("For Teachers" / "For Students"), each with a brief description matching the stated product philosophy ("How is my classroom doing?" vs. "How am I doing?") and a button. No auth check, no classroom awareness — this sits one layer above both.
- **`ui/views/StudentPlaceholderView.js`** (new) — a deliberately minimal "Student Portal — Coming soon" screen with a link back to the landing page. Not a stub of the real Student Portal: per the stated product philosophy, the Student Portal will be its own experience, not a restricted view of Classroom Tracker, so there's nothing here worth reusing once that work actually starts.
- **`router.js`** — three new top-level route names (`landing`, teacher's home reached via `/teacher`, `studentPlaceholder` via `/student`), added without touching the existing classroom-route parsing.
- **`main.js`** — imports and wires the two new views; the two fallback navigations corrected.
- **`styles.css`** — `.landing-view` and its journey-card styling added, reusing `.welcome-view`'s existing title/subtitle typography scale and the existing `.btn--primary`/color tokens rather than inventing a parallel system for what's structurally the same "centered title + subtitle" pattern.

### Files Modified
`src/js/ui/router.js`, `src/js/main.js`, `src/css/styles.css`. **Files created:** `src/js/ui/views/LandingView.js`, `src/js/ui/views/StudentPlaceholderView.js`. `index.html` needed no changes — the shell already just renders into `#app`/`#user-bar` based on route, which is exactly why this could be built additively.

### Breaking Changes
None to any existing Classroom Tracker functionality — verified directly, not assumed: a full regression pass after signing in through the new `/teacher` entry point exercised Settings (Groups/Students/Notebooks), notebook marking and Timeline, Class Mode (award + Undo), the Recognition Screen, the accent color picker, and the "Reset all classroom data" feature, all confirmed working exactly as before. Deep-linking directly to a classroom URL (bypassing the landing page and the `/teacher` address entirely) was also confirmed to still work, matching the router's own documented guarantee that deep links work on refresh.

### Regression Verification
Confirmed: the bare root shows the Bloom Labs landing page, not the login screen (a genuine, intentional behavior change from before, not a regression, since previously there was no landing page at all). Confirmed "Continue as Student" shows the placeholder with no auth prompt, and "Back to Bloom Labs" returns correctly. Confirmed "Continue as Teacher" leads to the *existing, unchanged* Google sign-in flow at `/teacher`. Confirmed a classroom created and used through this new entry point behaves identically to before across every major feature area, and that a direct deep link to `#/classroom/{id}` still bypasses the landing page entirely, exactly as it always has for any other route.

### Future TODOs
- Role-based routing (reading a Firestore `role` field to auto-route signed-in users, per the stated Authentication Vision) is explicitly out of scope for this phase — the landing page is a manual picker for now, not an automatic router.
- The real Student Portal experience, and Learning Hub, remain unbuilt — this phase is only the platform-level entry point in front of Classroom Tracker.
- (Carried over, unchanged): Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Google Account Chooser Fixed for Testing Both Modes

**Context:** wanting to freely switch accounts to test the Teacher and Student journeys separately. Traced this to a specific, well-known Firebase Auth behavior rather than guessing at a broader fix.

### The actual mechanism, found in the code
`signInWithGoogle()` created a plain `new GoogleAuthProvider()` with no parameters. Without `prompt: 'select_account'`, `signInWithPopup` will often silently reuse whichever Google account the *browser* is already signed into, rather than showing the account chooser. This app's own `signOutUser()` correctly clears the Firebase/app-level session, but that's a separate thing from the browser's underlying Google session — so the next sign-in attempt could still silently reauthenticate as the same account instead of prompting, which is exactly the friction described.

### Features Added
- **`GoogleAuthProvider.setCustomParameters({ prompt: 'select_account' })`** added to `signInWithGoogle()` — the standard fix for this exact symptom. Every sign-in attempt now shows Google's account chooser, letting a different account be picked deliberately instead of one being assumed.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/services/authService.js` — one function changed, two lines added.

### Breaking Changes
None. Every existing sign-in still works the same way; the only difference is Google's account chooser now always appears, rather than sometimes being skipped.

### A real testing limitation, disclosed rather than glossed over
This project's entire test harness (every regression pass throughout this whole build) mocks `authService.js` out completely, since there's no real Firebase/Google credential available in this sandboxed environment. That means this specific change — whether Google's account chooser actually appears — could not be verified end-to-end here the way every other feature in this project has been. The fix itself is syntax-checked and is the standard, documented solution for this exact behavior, but genuine confirmation needs to happen with real Google accounts, which is on the person testing this, not something achievable in this environment.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Role-based routing; real Student Portal; Learning Hub; Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## In-App Link Back to Bloom Labs

**Context:** a direct question — how to reach the Student placeholder while signed in as a teacher — surfaced a real gap: there was no in-app way to get back to the Bloom Labs landing page once inside the teacher app at all, only manual URL editing.

### Features Added
- **A small "← Bloom Labs" link** added to `UserBar.js`, next to Sign Out — present on every screen a teacher can reach, same as Sign Out itself. Pure navigation, no auth side effects: clicking it does not sign anyone out, so the teacher session survives the round trip to the landing page and back.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/components/UserBar.js` — new link added to the button group, `onBackToLanding` added to the render function's props.
- `src/js/main.js` — `onBackToLanding: () => router.navigate('/')` added to all three `renderUserBar()` call sites.

### Breaking Changes
None. Purely additive — every existing button, layout, and behavior in the UserBar is unchanged.

### Regression Verification
Confirmed the full round trip works from deep inside the app, not just from the teacher home screen: created a classroom, navigated into its dashboard, clicked "← Bloom Labs" from there, landed on the platform picker, went to the Student placeholder, came back, and chose "Continue as Teacher" again — confirmed this returned to the app *without* needing to sign in again, proving the session genuinely survives the trip rather than just appearing to. A full regression pass (Settings, Class Mode, the accent color picker, Recognition Screen) confirmed the new link didn't disturb anything else.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The link only navigates — it does not sign out.** Signing out and "going to look at another product" are different actions with different consequences; conflating them would have meant losing the teacher session every time someone just wanted to peek at the Student side, which is the opposite of what was asked for.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Role-based routing; real Student Portal; Learning Hub; Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Classroom ID + Co-Teacher Joining (Teacher-to-Teacher — Student-Facing Piece Deliberately Not Built)

**Context:** three related asks — a shareable classroom ID, a way to add a co-teacher, and the Student Portal asking for a classroom ID. The first two are teacher-to-teacher and safe to build now. The third runs directly into a boundary this project has carried since early on — see the dedicated section below rather than a quiet skip.

### What already existed, found before writing anything new
`models/Classroom.js` already had a `classroomJoinCode` field, reserved and always null, with its own doc comment anticipating exactly this: "a future student/parent joining flow... would populate this." `SettingsView.js`'s Teachers tab already had a disabled "+ Invite Teacher" button with "Coming soon." Neither needed inventing from scratch — this phase populates and wires up structure that was already anticipated.

### Features Added — Classroom ID (safe, teacher-only)
- **`generateJoinCode()`** (new, in `idGenerator.js`) — a 6-character human-shareable code, excluding visually ambiguous characters (0/O, 1/I/L), distinct from the existing UUID generator used for record ids.
- **`classroomService.ensureJoinCode()`** — lazily backfills a code for classrooms that predate this feature, called whenever Settings' Teachers tab is opened.
- **The disabled "+ Invite Teacher" placeholder is now a real Classroom ID display** with a Copy button, in the same tab, owner-visible.

### Features Added — Co-Teacher Joining (self-service, no email lookup needed)
This app has no way to look up another Google account by email (see `authService.js`'s own module comment) — so joining works the other way around: a co-teacher, signed into *their own* account, enters the classroom's ID themselves.
- **A new `joinCodes/{code}` lookup collection** (client code + proposed rules) maps a code to a classroom id — deliberately separate from the classroom document itself, since a non-member can't read that document at all under the current rules.
- **`workspaceService.joinClassroomByCode()`** resolves the code and adds the caller as a teacher member via a new, deliberately narrow repository method, `addSelfAsTeacher()` — additive only (`arrayUnion` plus one new map key), never a full document overwrite. The newly-joined classroom surfaces automatically through the *existing* `classroomRefs` subscription, the same mechanism that already makes a newly-created classroom appear on Home — no new state-sync logic was needed for that part.
- **`ui/components/JoinClassroomModal.js`** (new) — matches `NewClassroomModal.js`'s structure exactly. **"Join a Classroom" added to both `HomeView.js` and `WelcomeView.js`** — the latter matters specifically because a co-teacher signing in for the first time has *zero* classrooms yet, so `WelcomeView` (not `HomeView`) is the actual first screen they'd land on.

### A required Firestore rules change — proposed, not verified
Confirmed directly in `firestore.rules`: the current rule only lets an existing member read a classroom document at all, so `getClassroomIdByJoinCode` and `addSelfAsTeacher` cannot work against the currently-deployed rules as they stand. Two additions proposed in `firestore.rules` itself: a `joinCodes` collection (readable by any signed-in user, write-once, revealing only an opaque classroom id — no student data, no scores, nothing sensitive), and a narrowly-scoped second path on the classroom `allow update` rule permitting a non-member to add *exactly their own uid* and nothing else (checked via `diff().affectedKeys()`, rejecting any write that touches another field). This project's sandboxed environment has no real Firebase credentials, so unlike every other piece of client code in this phase, this rules change could not be tested end-to-end — it needs its own review and testing against a real Firestore project before being deployed, the same as the Google account-chooser fix from a previous phase.

### The Student Portal piece — flagged directly, not quietly built or quietly skipped
Asking the Student Portal for a classroom ID means validating that code against real classroom data from an *unauthenticated* visitor — a real student-facing data flow, not a UI-only placeholder anymore. This project's organizational data-handling rules require escalating anything involving sensitive/student data to the AI Working Committee before proceeding, and this exact category — "Student/Parent onboarding" — has been listed as blocked pending that review in this CHANGELOG's Future TODOs since early in the project. This is the first time that flag has been concretely, rather than abstractly, relevant. Nothing was built for it this phase; it needs that review first, not a workaround.

### Files Modified
- `src/js/utils/idGenerator.js` — `generateJoinCode()` added.
- `src/js/services/classroomService.js` — `ensureJoinCode()` added.
- `src/js/services/workspaceService.js` — `createJoinCodeMapping()`, `joinClassroomByCode()` added.
- `src/js/repositories/classroomRepository.js`, `firestoreClassroomRepository.js` — three new methods each (`createJoinCodeMapping`, `getClassroomIdByJoinCode`, `addSelfAsTeacher`).
- `src/js/ui/views/SettingsView.js` — Teachers tab's invite placeholder replaced with the real Classroom ID display.
- `src/js/ui/views/HomeView.js`, `WelcomeView.js` — "Join a Classroom" added alongside "+ New Classroom."
- `src/js/ui/components/JoinClassroomModal.js` (new).
- `src/js/main.js` — `handleJoinClassroom()` added; wired into both Home and Welcome.
- `firestore.rules` — proposed additions, clearly marked as unverified in this environment.
- `src/css/styles.css` — join-code display, modal description/error text, and the two new action-button layouts.

### Breaking Changes
None to existing functionality — confirmed via a full regression pass (Settings' Groups/Students/Notebooks tabs, the Danger Zone reset feature, notebook marking, Class Mode, Recognition Screen) with zero errors.

### Regression Verification
The full join flow was tested with two genuinely distinct simulated teacher identities (not the same uid twice): Teacher A created a classroom and viewed its generated Classroom ID in Settings; Teacher A signed out; Teacher B signed in fresh (zero classrooms, landing on `WelcomeView`); Teacher B used "Join a Classroom" with Teacher A's code; confirmed Teacher B landed on the *exact same* classroom Teacher A created, and — reopening Settings' Teachers tab — that Teacher B now appears in the member list. This is the first test in this project's history that needed a mock supporting more than one simulated identity, added specifically to verify this feature honestly rather than testing a same-user round-trip and calling it equivalent.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **`addSelfAsTeacher()` was designed narrow specifically because of the security rule it would need** — an additive-only write (one new map key, one `arrayUnion` append) is the only shape that makes "a non-member may safely write this" expressible at all; a full-document-overwrite approach would have made a safe rule impossible to write.
- **The join-code lookup was built as a separate, low-sensitivity collection rather than a query against `classrooms` itself** — a query would require read access the requester doesn't have yet; a tiny mapping document that reveals nothing but an opaque id sidesteps that without weakening the classroom document's own access control at all.
- **The Student Portal's classroom-ID lookup was not built, and that decision is named rather than left implicit** — this is exactly the kind of student-facing data flow this project has held as needing the AI Working Committee's review first, and treating "asked for it directly" as an override of that standing rule would be the wrong call.

### Future TODOs
- Have the proposed `firestore.rules` changes reviewed and tested against a real Firestore project, then deployed.
- Escalate the Student Portal's classroom-ID validation to the AI Working Committee, per this project's own data-handling rules, before building any part of it.
- (Carried over, unchanged): Role-based routing; real Student Portal; Learning Hub; Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Student Portal Foundation (Placeholder Data — Real Student Data Still Not Wired)

**Context:** Bloom Labs' architecture now names three products (Classroom Tracker, Student Portal, Learning Hub) with the Student Portal's implementation "approved," explicitly ruling out photo storage in favor of generated avatars. The foundation is built in full. Real student authentication and real Firestore reads tied to an identifiable student are not — see the dedicated section below for why that boundary still holds, and why this spec (thoughtful as it is about avoiding photos specifically) doesn't change the underlying reasoning.

### Platform-level vs. product-level — decisions made explicit, as requested
- **The avatar generator is platform-level** (`utils/avatarGenerator.js`), not nested under the Student Portal. Classroom Tracker already shows initials-in-a-circle in three different places (`RecognitionCard.js`, `TeamCard`'s huddle avatars, `UserBar`'s fallback) — each with its own slightly different initials/color logic. Rather than adding a fourth bespoke implementation for the Portal, this centralizes the pattern so all four call sites *could* eventually share one implementation (not done this phase, to keep the change small — see Future TODOs).
- **The Student Portal's views and shell are product-level**, in their own `ui/student-portal/` directory — not mixed into `ui/views/` alongside Classroom Tracker's screens. The product philosophy is explicit that this isn't "a restricted view of Classroom Tracker," and the file layout now reflects that as directly as the UI does.
- **The placeholder data service is product-level** (`services/studentPortalDataService.js`) but its *field shapes* deliberately mirror `models/Student.js`/`models/Classroom.js` rather than inventing a parallel structure — reflecting the stated data philosophy ("reuse existing Firestore data wherever possible") even though no real Firestore reads exist yet. When this does get wired to real data, it should be a thin read over the same classroom document Classroom Tracker already uses.

### Features Added
- **`utils/avatarGenerator.js`** — `getInitials()` and `getAvatarForPerson()`, the latter returning `{ type: 'generated', initials, color }` today. Every caller branches on `type` rather than assuming `initials`/`color` exist, specifically so a future `{ type: 'photo', url }` variant is a change to this one function, not to every screen showing an avatar — directly satisfying "design the avatar system so photo support could be added later without changing the rest of the architecture." Verified via direct execution that 9 sample names produce well-distributed initials and colors (not a degenerate hash always landing on the same value).
- **`services/studentPortalDataService.js`** — the Portal's sole data source, returning explicitly-labeled placeholder data (a single named `PLACEHOLDER_STUDENT` constant, not scattered mock values).
- **`ui/student-portal/StudentPortalShell.js`** — persistent navigation across the 5 required sections (Home/Achievements/Team/Learn/Profile), plus a small link back to the Bloom Labs landing page (the same real gap identified and fixed on the teacher side previously — it applies equally here).
- **Five section views** — Home (the 5 specified cards: My Stars, My Team, Recognition Wall, My Journey, Continue Learning), Achievements, Team, Learn (an honest "coming soon," since Learning Hub doesn't exist), and Profile (generated avatar, name, classroom, group, role — no photo upload anywhere).
- **A dedicated, self-contained CSS register** for the whole Portal — deliberately not reusing `.tracker-header`/`.dashboard-widget` or Classroom Tracker's color tokens, so nothing here looks like the same admin app wearing a different hat, matching "avoid admin dashboards and teacher terminology."
- **Router extended** — `#/student/{section}` sub-routes replace the old flat placeholder route; `#/student` alone defaults to Home.

### A real bug caught by testing, not by re-reading the code
The very first end-to-end test run failed immediately: `Identifier 'renderStudentProfileView' has already been declared`. Investigating found a genuine naming collision — Classroom Tracker already has its own `StudentProfileView.js` (a teacher looking at one student's profile from inside a classroom), a completely different screen from the new Student Portal's "my own profile" view, which happened to export a function with the exact same name. Fixed by aliasing the new import (`renderStudentPortalProfileView`) rather than renaming the existing, working Classroom Tracker file — the old one was correct as it stood; the new one was the thing that needed to adapt. Caught by actually running the app, not by reasoning about the code in isolation.

### The Student Portal's real data — still not wired, and why this spec doesn't change that
This phase's spec is thoughtful about avoiding one specific risk (photo storage) but doesn't address the deeper one: real student authentication plus a persistent, trackable Firestore record for an identifiable minor is itself what triggers India's DPDP Act's children's-data provisions (Section 9, requiring verifiable parental consent), which is what this project's own organizational data-handling rules require escalating to the AI Working Committee before proceeding. Nothing in this phase's implementation touches real authentication or real student records — every field shown anywhere in the Portal comes from the placeholder service, confirmed directly: `getCurrentStudentProfile()`, `getHomeSummary()`, `getAchievements()`, and `getTeamSummary()` are the *only* functions any Portal view calls for data, and none of them touch Firestore.

### Files Created
- `src/js/utils/avatarGenerator.js`
- `src/js/services/studentPortalDataService.js`
- `src/js/ui/student-portal/StudentPortalShell.js`
- `src/js/ui/student-portal/views/StudentHomeView.js`, `StudentAchievementsView.js`, `StudentTeamView.js`, `StudentLearnView.js`, `StudentProfileView.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/router.js` — `#/student/{section}` sub-routing.
- `src/js/main.js` — new imports (one aliased to resolve the naming collision above); `studentPortal` route handling replacing the old flat placeholder dispatch.
- `src/js/ui/views/LandingView.js` — one stale comment reference updated.
- `src/css/styles.css` — the full Student Portal CSS block appended.

### Files Removed
- `src/js/ui/views/StudentPlaceholderView.js` — fully superseded by the real shell; confirmed via grep that nothing else referenced it before deleting.

### New Firestore Fields or Collections Introduced
**None.** This phase introduces no new Firestore reads, writes, fields, or collections — every Portal screen renders from the in-memory placeholder service only. (For context: the *previous* phase's Classroom ID / co-teacher joining feature did introduce a new `joinCodes/{code}` collection and a narrowly-scoped classroom `allow update` rule addition, both still pending the user's own review against a real Firestore project — unrelated to this phase's work, and unaffected by it.)

### Breaking Changes
None. A full regression pass confirmed every piece of existing Classroom Tracker functionality — Settings (Groups/Students/Notebooks/Teachers/Danger Zone), the Classroom ID display, notebook marking and Timeline (default weekly mode), Class Mode (award + Undo, icon-only buttons), the Recognition Screen, the accent color picker, and the Bloom Labs link — all work exactly as before, unaffected by anything added this phase.

### Regression Verification
The full Student Portal was tested end-to-end: default landing on Home with exactly 5 cards matching the spec's exact titles; Achievements/Team/Learn/Profile all render their placeholder content correctly; the Profile view's generated avatar shows the correct initials and a color that matches the same deterministic hash verified directly against the utility function; a direct deep link to `#/student/team` renders correctly without going through Home first; the Bloom Labs back-link works. Separately, a full Classroom Tracker regression (Settings, Teachers tab, Danger Zone, notebook marking, Class Mode, Recognition Screen, accent colors, the Bloom Labs link) confirmed zero impact on existing functionality.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The avatar generator was placed at the platform level even though only the Student Portal explicitly asked for it** — Classroom Tracker already had three different ad-hoc "initials in a circle" implementations scattered across its own components; introducing a fourth, bespoke one for the Portal would have been the wrong call given "prefer reusable services and shared models over product-specific implementations." Consolidating all four into one shared implementation was considered but not done this phase, to keep this change small and focused — flagged as a real follow-up, not silently done partway.
- **The placeholder data service exists as a named, single-purpose file rather than inline mock values in each view** — specifically so there's exactly one place to change when real data wiring is eventually approved, rather than five views each needing their own update.
- **The Student Portal was NOT given its own theme/accent-color picker**, unlike the teacher app — that feature is explicitly a per-teacher preference (see its own CHANGELOG entry), and nothing in this phase's spec asked for a student-facing equivalent; adding one would have been scope creep beyond what was requested.

### Future TODOs
- Consolidate Classroom Tracker's three existing ad-hoc initials-in-a-circle implementations (`RecognitionCard.js`, `TeamCard`'s huddle avatars, `UserBar`'s fallback) onto the new shared `avatarGenerator.js`, now that it exists — not done this phase to keep this change focused on the Student Portal itself.
- Wire the Student Portal to real student data — blocked pending the AI Working Committee review described above; this is not a technical gap, it's a compliance gate.
- Have the previous phase's proposed `firestore.rules` changes (join codes, co-teacher self-add) reviewed and tested against a real Firestore project.
- (Carried over, unchanged): real Student Portal authentication; Learning Hub; role-based routing; Learning Bucket-tied Recognition avatars; Pending Tasks collapse-state persistence; downstream palette travel; Classroom Culture; Phase 7C polish; Phase 6B Workspace Personalization; theme-service file cleanup; all previously-listed items.

## Student Portal: First-Visit Classroom ID, Remembered Sessions, Join Another Classroom

**Context:** direct feedback that clicking into the Student Portal with a fresh session just showed the placeholder shell, when it should ask for a Classroom ID on first visit, remember it afterward, and let Profile offer joining a different classroom.

### What was built — the interaction pattern, on a client-only placeholder mechanism
- **`services/studentSessionService.js`** (new) — remembers, per browser via `localStorage`, which code a visitor entered. A separate, small module rather than reusing `storage/localStorageAdapter.js`, whose own doc comment states "nothing new is ever written here" (it's a one-time migration adapter) — respecting that file's stated contract rather than quietly overloading it for a genuinely different, ongoing purpose.
- **`ui/student-portal/views/StudentJoinCodeView.js`** (new) — the first-visit screen. Accepts any plausible, non-empty code (checked only for length, not looked up against real data) and stores it.
- **`main.js`** now gates the whole Student Portal on `studentSessionService.getJoinedCode()`: no stored code → the join screen; a stored code → the shell, exactly as before.
- **Profile's new "Join Another Classroom" button** clears the stored code and re-renders the current route, which naturally falls back to the join screen — then, after entering a new code, returns to wherever the visitor was (confirmed via testing: joining again from Profile lands back on Profile, not Home).

### The same boundary as before, applied to this specific mechanism
This does not look up the entered code against any real classroom. Whatever is typed is accepted, and the same placeholder dashboard renders regardless — a real teacher's actual Classroom ID would not "work" here any differently from a made-up one, because no real lookup exists. That's deliberate, not an oversight: building a genuine lookup against real classroom/student data is the same piece this project has held behind the AI Working Committee review throughout (see the Student Portal Foundation entry above for the full reasoning) — the DPDP trigger is real student authentication and a persistent, trackable identity, not the specific UI pattern of asking for a code. This phase builds and lets the *interaction pattern* be reviewed now, entirely separately from that still-pending decision.

### Files Created
- `src/js/services/studentSessionService.js`
- `src/js/ui/student-portal/views/StudentJoinCodeView.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/js/main.js` — first-visit gate added to the `studentPortal` route; Profile's join-another wiring.
- `src/js/ui/student-portal/views/StudentProfileView.js` — `onJoinAnotherClassroom` prop and button added.
- `src/css/styles.css` — join-code screen and profile button styling.

### New Firestore Fields or Collections Introduced
**None.** The remembered code lives only in this browser's `localStorage`, not Firestore — consistent with this being a client-side interaction pattern, not real classroom membership.

### Breaking Changes
None. Every existing Student Portal section and all of Classroom Tracker were re-verified working exactly as before.

### Regression Verification
Confirmed via a real, full page reload (not just in-app navigation) that a joined code persists correctly and skips straight to the shell on a fresh page load — the important test here, since an in-memory-only check wouldn't have proven the "remembered across visits" behavior actually works. Confirmed a too-short code shows an error and does not proceed; confirmed "Join Another Classroom" correctly returns to the join screen and, after entering a new code, lands back on the exact section the visitor was on (Profile), not a hardcoded default. All 5 Student Portal sections and a full separate Classroom Tracker pass (Settings, Class Mode) both confirmed unaffected.

### Future TODOs
- (Carried over, unchanged): Wire the Student Portal to real student data, pending the AI Working Committee review; consolidate Classroom Tracker's three ad-hoc avatar implementations onto the shared generator; have the proposed `firestore.rules` changes reviewed; real Student Portal authentication; Learning Hub; role-based routing; all previously-listed items.

## Class Session Architecture — Draft-Until-Save for Class Mode

**Context:** an architectural change to how Class Mode persists data, requested with an explicit "review first, explain, then implement" — reported symptom: accidental clicks were becoming permanent history, and undoing still left traces, because every interaction wrote to Firestore immediately.

### What was found in the current implementation, before any code was written
Traced every write path directly rather than assuming: `handleTap`, `handleSwipeLeft`, badge award (both paths), and bucket change in `TrackerView.js` each called `workspaceService.save(classroom)` immediately after mutating in-memory state — and critically, **so did `classModeService.undo()`'s caller**. This is the literal mechanism behind the reported bug: an accidental tap and its undo were two *separate* Firestore writes, with a real window between them where the mistake was live on the server, observable by anything else subscribed to that classroom, before the undo's write caught up. `NotebookRegisterView.js` had the same shape (400ms-debounced auto-save, no session concept). Also found: `noteService.addNote()` has no undo wired into `classModeService`'s stack at all — an existing, separate gap, named explicitly rather than silently folded into this work or silently left unmentioned.

### Architecture
- **`services/classSessionService.js`** (new) — a Class Session is in-memory only, per classroom, exactly like `classModeService`'s existing (already in-memory) undo stack sits alongside it. A session holds a simple action log (`{ type, at }`) used only for the Session Review's counts — it does not duplicate what the undo stack already tracks for reversal. Two terminal operations:
  - **`commitSession()`** — the single permanent write. Calls `workspaceService.save()` exactly once, then clears the undo stack and the session log.
  - **`discardSession()`** — re-fetches the classroom from Firestore (`getClassroomOnce()`, new) and overwrites the in-memory copy, throwing away every draft mutation at once. Chosen over trying to reverse each drafted action individually: since nothing was ever written, the server's copy is already correct — re-fetching it is simpler and can't drift from whatever the undo stack did or didn't track.
- **Every per-action `workspaceService.save()` call removed from `TrackerView.js`** — award star, deduct point, badge award (both paths), bucket change all still mutate in-memory state exactly as before (so the UI stays live), but now call `classSessionService.recordAction()` instead of saving. This directly satisfies "refactor so all permanent writes happen through a single session commit mechanism": previously 6 different call sites wrote to Firestore; now exactly one function does.
- **Undo no longer triggers a save** — since nothing is written until the session ends, there's no longer a race between an action's write and its undo's write to worry about; undo purely reverses in-memory state, exactly as `classModeService.undo()` already did.
- **`ui/components/SessionReview.js`** (new) — the screen shown by a new "End Class" button in Class Mode's header, matching the spec's exact layout (Stars Awarded / Behaviour Notes / Notebook Updates / Recognitions, then Continue Teaching / Save Session / Discard Session). Counts come from the session's in-memory action log, not Firestore.
- **`NotebookRegisterView.js`** — status changes now check `classSessionService.isSessionActive()`. If a session is active (Register reached mid-lesson via Class Mode's header), a change becomes a draft (recorded, no write). Outside an active session (marking notebooks independently, not mid-lesson), the existing immediate debounced auto-save is completely unchanged — confirmed via testing, not assumed.
- **Leaving Class Mode mid-session (the header's Back button) now warns first** if there are unsaved draft actions, and — if the teacher confirms leaving anyway — actually calls `discardSession()` rather than just navigating away. Without this, the shared in-memory classroom object (used by every other view, including the Dashboard) would keep showing unsaved draft state as if it had been saved, which would be actively misleading.

### How existing reports and history continue working
Unchanged, by design: the data shape written on commit (`student.history`, `student.score`, `student.badges`, notebook entries) is byte-for-byte identical to what immediate-write mode used to produce. Recognition Wall, streaks, and Weekly Snapshot read that data the same way regardless of whether it arrived via the old per-action write path or the new single-commit path — only *when* the write happens changed, never *what* gets written.

### A real bug caught mid-implementation, not assumed away
A scripted find-and-replace, wiring `NotebookRegisterView.js`'s two `debouncedSave(classroom)` call sites over to the new `saveOrRecordDraft()`, matched a third occurrence: the literal string inside `saveOrRecordDraft()`'s own function body, turning its `else` branch into infinite self-recursion. Caught immediately by grepping the result before moving on to testing — not something that would have been visible from reading the diff casually.

### Files Created
- `src/js/services/classSessionService.js`
- `src/js/ui/components/SessionReview.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/views/TrackerView.js` — every per-action save removed; "End Class" button added; Back-button unsaved-changes warning added; module doc comment rewritten to describe the session model.
- `src/js/ui/views/NotebookRegisterView.js` — `saveOrRecordDraft()` added, session-aware.
- `src/js/repositories/classroomRepository.js`, `firestoreClassroomRepository.js` — `getClassroomOnce()` added.
- `src/js/services/workspaceService.js` — `reloadClassroomFromServer()` added.
- `src/css/styles.css` — Session Review screen styling.

### Breaking Changes
None to existing data or reports. Behavior changes only in *when* a permanent write happens during Class Mode — a teacher must now explicitly Save Session (or a notebook change must happen outside an active session) for anything to reach Firestore.

### Regression Verification
Using a real save-counter injected into the test harness's mock repository (not just checking the UI looks right): confirmed 3 stars + 1 swipe + 1 Undo produced **zero** Firestore writes against a baseline count; confirmed Save Session produced **exactly one** write; confirmed Discard Session produced **zero** writes and that reopening Class Mode afterward correctly showed the last-*saved* score, not the discarded draft — proving the re-fetch mechanism genuinely reverts to server state rather than just looking like it does. Separately confirmed notebook marking outside an active session still auto-saves immediately, unchanged. A full regression pass (Settings, Danger Zone, Recognition Screen, accent color picker, icon navigation) confirmed zero impact elsewhere.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **A dedicated session model was introduced rather than conditionals scattered through existing action handlers** — every action handler's own logic (award, deduct, badge, bucket) is completely unchanged; only the "what happens after" step (save vs. record) changed, and it changed in exactly one place per handler, not through an `if (session) ... else ...` sprinkled across the file.
- **Discard re-fetches rather than reverses** — reversing each drafted action individually would require the session log to track enough detail to undo *every* kind of action perfectly, duplicating logic `classModeService`'s undo stack already has for some of them and lacks for others (like notes). Re-fetching the known-correct server state sidesteps needing that parity at all.
- **The note-undo gap was named, not fixed and not hidden** — notes still have no undo in `classModeService`'s stack, a pre-existing limitation unrelated to this refactor; adding it would have been scope creep beyond what was asked.

### Future TODOs
- Consider adding undo support for notes to `classModeService`'s stack, closing the one remaining gap in Class Mode's action coverage.
- (Carried over, unchanged): Wire the Student Portal to real student data, pending AI Working Committee review; consolidate Classroom Tracker's ad-hoc avatar implementations; have the proposed `firestore.rules` changes reviewed; real Student Portal authentication; Learning Hub; role-based routing; all previously-listed items.

## Class Mode UX Refinement (Items 1-5) — Session Lock and Session History Not Yet Built

**Context:** moving from architecture to teacher-experience polish on top of the Class Session model from the previous phase. Eight items requested; this entry covers the five that build cleanly on the existing architecture without new data modeling. The remaining two — Session Lock and Session History — need a genuinely new permanent record shape and deserve focused treatment rather than being rushed alongside these; see Future TODOs.

### 1. Button renamed
"End Class" → **"Review Session"**, not "Finish & Review". Chosen to match this app's existing button-naming pattern (Save Session, Reset Session — verb + "Session", not a compound/ampersand phrase used nowhere else in this app's vocabulary) — the button was never claimed to end anything; it opens a review, and the new name says exactly that.

### 2. Unsaved Changes indicator
A small dot + "Unsaved Changes" label appears next to the Class Mode title the moment `classSessionService.getSessionSummary()` reports any draft actions, and disappears automatically once the session is saved or discarded (since that summary naturally reports zero afterward — no separate show/hide logic needed).

### 3. Session Review reorganized
Four icon-labeled stat cards in a 2×2 grid, in the requested order (⭐ Stars Awarded, 🏅 Recognitions, 📓 Notebook Updates, 📝 Behaviour Notes) — replacing the previous plain list of label/value rows.

### 4. Top Contributors
`classSessionService.recordAction()` now optionally takes the student the action belonged to, and a new `getTopContributors()` ranks by **star count specifically** — matching the spec's own example ("+4 Stars") rather than a blended "positive actions" score mixing stars and badges, which would be harder to explain at a glance. Ties use **dense ranking**: distinct star counts map to gold/silver/bronze in order regardless of how many students share a count, so a tie for 1st still gives out a silver to the next distinct count rather than skipping it — chosen because a small, three-spot display reads oddly with a medal missing. The section is hidden entirely when there are no positive actions, per the spec.

### 5. Unsaved Navigation Warning
- **In-app navigation** (the header's Back button): now opens `ui/components/UnsavedSessionDialog.js`, a proper 3-option modal (Continue Teaching / Discard & Leave / Save & Leave), replacing the previous 2-option `window.confirm()` — a plain confirm can't express three distinct outcomes.
- **Page refresh/tab close**: wired via `beforeunload` in `main.js`. Documented plainly, not glossed over: browsers do not allow custom dialog text or buttons here — this can only trigger the browser's own generic "leave site?" prompt, not the 3-option dialog. That's a platform limitation, not an implementation gap.
- **Switching classrooms**: covered by the same Back-button dialog, since leaving Class Mode via Back is the only path to reaching a different classroom from here — no separate check was needed.

### A real bug caught and fixed before it reached testing
Adding the draft indicator's `if` block left it unclosed for one edit — everything after it in the header (the action buttons, "Review Session," all of it) was silently nested inside that conditional, meaning the whole header would have vanished whenever there was no active draft. Caught by viewing the actual resulting file structure immediately after the edit, not by trusting that the syntax check alone (which passed, since the resulting nesting was still syntactically valid JS) meant the change was correct.

### Files Created
- `src/js/ui/components/UnsavedSessionDialog.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/js/services/classSessionService.js` — `recordAction()` now takes an optional student; `getTopContributors()` and `hasAnyUnsavedSession()` added.
- `src/js/ui/views/TrackerView.js` — button renamed; draft indicator added; Back button rewired to the 3-option dialog; all `recordAction()` calls updated to pass the student.
- `src/js/ui/components/SessionReview.js` — rebuilt around icon stat-cards and a Top Contributors section.
- `src/js/main.js` — `beforeunload` handler added.
- `src/css/styles.css` — draft indicator, stat-card grid, Top Contributors, and the dialog's stacked-button layout.

### Breaking Changes
None. All five items are additive UX on top of the unchanged Class Session architecture — no change to when or what gets written to Firestore.

### Regression Verification
Built a 3-student scenario (4/3/2 stars) specifically to test Top Contributors' ranking and medal assignment, not just that the section renders — confirmed the exact medal-to-count mapping matches the spec's own example precisely. Confirmed the indicator is absent with zero draft actions and appears correctly worded once any exist. Confirmed the 3-option dialog appears on Back with pending changes, and that both Save & Leave and Discard & Leave produce the correct persisted/reverted score afterward — re-verified by reopening Class Mode after each, not just trusting the dialog's own claim.

### A test-methodology issue worth naming, since it looked like an app bug at first
An early test run failed with a null bounding-box error when tapping a second and third student's row. Investigating found the cause was in the test script, not the app: Class Mode's view re-renders entirely on every tap, so a `page.$$()` element list captured before the first student's taps goes stale by the time the test tries to use it for the second student. Fixed by re-querying fresh before each tap rather than assuming the first query stayed valid — worth recording since it's exactly the kind of result that could be misread as a real regression without checking further.

### Future TODOs
- **Session Lock (10-minute reopen window)** and **Session History (a permanent Session record students' history entries reference)** — items 6 and 7 from this request — not built this phase. Both need a genuinely new data model (a permanent session record, timestamp-based lock logic that survives a refresh) rather than the UI-layer changes covered here, and deserve their own focused pass rather than being fit into whatever budget remained in this one.
- (Carried over, unchanged): note-undo gap in `classModeService`; Student Portal real-data wiring pending AI Working Committee review; consolidate avatar implementations; `firestore.rules` review; Learning Hub; role-based routing; all previously-listed items.

## Student Identity Architecture — StudentIdentityService, Provider/Consent Interfaces, Demo Implementations

**Context:** the finalized Bloom Labs authentication direction — Google Sign-In for parents, separated from student identity via a linking step (PIN or invitation link). Built in full on fixture data (`DemoIdentityProvider`, `DemoConsentProvider`, `DemoStudentLinkRepository`) per explicit agreement: production identity and real consent capture stay behind interfaces, unimplemented, so this is safe to build now without touching the still-open compliance question described in the Student Portal entries above.

### Architecture
- **`IdentityProvider`** (interface) — "who is this authenticated user," nothing more. `DemoIdentityProvider` simulates a parent's Google sign-in with a fixed demo identity. A production `GoogleIdentityProvider` (wrapping Firebase Auth, the same pattern `authService.js` already uses for teachers) is not part of this phase.
- **`ConsentProvider`** (interface, placeholder only, per explicit instruction) — `DemoConsentProvider` always answers "granted," instantly. Every linking call in `studentIdentityService.js` already checks through this interface — the check exists, it is just not load-bearing yet. Documented plainly, more than once, so `DemoConsentProvider`'s automatic approval is never mistaken for real consent capture.
- **`StudentLinkRepository`** (interface) — the persistence contract, documented against a real proposed Firestore model even though `DemoStudentLinkRepository` never touches Firestore:
  - `identityLinks/{providerUserId}` — the account-to-student mapping, keyed by provider user id (not classroom/student) so a sign-in resolves in one document read; `provider` stored per-link so Microsoft/SSO/OTP can write into the same collection later without a schema change.
  - A student's PIN lives on the *existing* student object inside its classroom document, not a parallel top-level `students` collection — reusing the current nested model, per Bloom Labs' stated data-reuse philosophy.
  - `invitationTokens/{token}` — its own small collection, same reasoning as the co-teacher join-code collection from an earlier phase: a token needs to be resolvable by someone not yet linked to anything, which a full classroom document can't safely allow.
- **`studentIdentityService.js`** — the only thing any Student Portal screen imports. Composes the three interfaces; swapping to production is changing three instantiations in this one file, nothing downstream.

### Two real bugs found through testing, not assumed correct
1. **Invitation links never actually worked as designed.** `main.js` read the token from `window.location.search` — the page's real, pre-`#` query string — but the invitation URL puts the token *inside* the hash fragment (`#/student?token=...`), which is a completely different, unrelated string in a hash-based router. Separately, `router.js`'s own path-splitting had no handling for a `?query` suffix at all, so `#/student?token=xxx` parsed as one broken path segment (`student?token=xxx`) instead of the path `student` plus a token param — meaning the route wasn't even recognized as the Student Portal, let alone carrying the token correctly. Both fixed together: `router.js` now splits off and parses a hash-embedded query string into `route.query` for every route (not just this one), and `main.js` reads `route.query.token` instead of the unrelated real query string.
2. **A parent clicking a second child's invitation link while already linked to a first child was silently ignored.** The onboarding flow checked "is a student already resolved" before checking "is there an invitation token to process," so an already-linked parent visiting a *new* invitation link just saw their existing child's Home screen, with the token never touched at all — exactly backwards for the multi-student requirement this whole feature is partly about. Fixed by processing a present invitation token first, always, before falling back to the already-resolved fast path.

Both were caught by testing the actual flow with a real Playwright browser, not by re-reading the code — the first surfaced as the invitation link routing to Classroom Tracker's own login screen instead of the Student Portal at all; the second surfaced as the "Who's learning today?" picker never appearing after a real navigation to a token URL, even though the exact same token/redemption logic worked correctly when exercised directly.

### Features Added
- **Onboarding flow** (`StudentOnboardingFlow.js`) — sign in → invitation token (if present) or PIN → multi-student picker (only if more than one student is linked) → done. Supersedes and replaces the earlier classroom-code + `localStorage` placeholder flow entirely (`StudentJoinCodeView.js`, `studentSessionService.js` — both removed, confirmed via grep that nothing else referenced them first).
- **"Who's learning today?" picker** and **Profile's "Switch Student"** — reuses the shared avatar generator, so a sibling's picker entry matches their own Profile avatar rather than a generic placeholder.
- **Teacher-side "Portal Access" section** (Student Profile, Overview tab) — Generate/Reset/Copy/Share for the Student PIN. Share builds a single-use, 7-day invitation link and uses the native share sheet (`navigator.share`) when available, falling back to clipboard copy.

### Files Created
- `src/js/services/identity/IdentityProvider.js`, `DemoIdentityProvider.js`, `ConsentProvider.js`, `DemoConsentProvider.js`
- `src/js/repositories/identity/StudentLinkRepository.js`, `DemoStudentLinkRepository.js`
- `src/js/services/studentIdentityService.js`
- `src/js/ui/student-portal/onboarding/StudentSignInView.js`, `StudentLinkView.js`, `StudentPickerView.js`, `StudentOnboardingFlow.js`

### Files Modified
- `src/js/ui/router.js` — hash-embedded query string parsing (`route.query`), needed correctly for any future route, not just this one.
- `src/js/main.js` — `studentPortal` route rewired to the new onboarding flow; token read from `route.query`.
- `src/js/ui/views/StudentProfileView.js` (teacher-side) — Portal Access / PIN management section added.
- `src/js/ui/student-portal/views/StudentProfileView.js` (Portal-side) — `onJoinAnotherClassroom` renamed to `onSwitchStudent`, button text updated.

### Files Removed
- `src/js/ui/student-portal/views/StudentJoinCodeView.js`, `src/js/services/studentSessionService.js` — superseded by the finalized Google + PIN/invitation-link direction.

### Breaking Changes
None to Classroom Tracker. The `router.js` change is additive (a new `query` field on every route object) and was specifically regression-tested against routes with multiple path parameters (Notebook Register's subject/type/date, Notebook Timeline's subject/type/yearMonth, Recognition Screen's period/category) to confirm the refactor didn't disturb existing multi-segment parsing.

### Regression Verification
Confirmed end-to-end with real browser navigation (not just service-level calls): sign-in, wrong-PIN rejection, correct-PIN linking, and — via a genuine full page reload — that linking is remembered. Confirmed invitation token generation, redemption, and that a second redemption attempt on the same token correctly fails (single-use). Confirmed the multi-student picker actually renders after a real navigation to an invitation link while already linked to a first student, that selecting a second student updates "last selected" correctly across another real reload, and that Profile's "Switch Student" reopens the picker. Confirmed the teacher-side Portal Access section renders without error with the correct PIN. A full Classroom Tracker regression (Settings, Teachers tab, notebook marking across multi-segment routes, Class Mode, Session Review, Recognition Screen with re-navigation across different params) confirmed zero impact elsewhere.

### Architectural Decisions Made During Implementation
- **The PIN is designed to live on the existing student object, not a new collection** — directly reusing Bloom Labs' stated data philosophy, and avoiding a parallel source of truth for "which students exist" that could drift from the classroom document Classroom Tracker already treats as authoritative.
- **`ConsentProvider` was still built as a real interface with real call sites, not a stub nobody calls** — every linking path in `studentIdentityService.js` already checks consent, so that a production `ConsentProvider` genuinely gates linking the moment it's implemented, rather than requiring new call sites to be added retroactively throughout the linking logic.
- **The invitation-token bug was fixed at the router level, not with a one-off parameter read in `main.js`** — a hash-based router needs to support query-like params in its fragment generally, not just for this one feature; fixing it once, generically, means the next feature that needs a URL parameter doesn't hit the same bug.

### Future TODOs
- Production `GoogleIdentityProvider` and a real `ConsentProvider` (disclosure + affirmative parent/guardian confirmation + stored consent record) — both remain gated behind the same compliance review described in the Student Portal Foundation entry above.
- (Carried over, unchanged): note-undo gap in `classModeService`; Session Lock and Session History from the Class Mode UX phase; consolidate avatar implementations; `firestore.rules` review; Learning Hub; role-based routing; all previously-listed items.
