 * reading old data, which is exactly the gap this function exists to

 * as it was actually requested.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT touch classroom structure/configuration —
 * teams, student names, notebookConfig, learningActivities'
 * definitions, or classroom.settings all survive this untouched; only
 * per-student accumulated data is cleared. Clearing
 * classroom.notebooks (a classroom-level field, not per-student) is a
