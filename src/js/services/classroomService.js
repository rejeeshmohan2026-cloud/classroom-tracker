 * Holds the in-memory list of Classrooms the signed-in teacher belongs

 * (create, update, delete, list, and importing a roster into an
 * already-created classroom). workspaceService is responsible for
 * loading/persisting this list via Firestore — this module only manages
 * it in memory and builds new records.
 *
 * Each classroom now arrives from its own independent Firestore
 * listener (one per classroom the teacher belongs to — see
 * workspaceService.js), rather than one batch read of "all my
 * classrooms" — so this module updates one classroom at a time
 * (upsertClassroom/removeClassroomFromMemory) instead of replacing the
