/**
 * services/classModeService.js
 *
 * The action layer behind Class Mode: awarding a star, deducting a
 * point, quick-awarding a badge, and quick-changing a bucket, each
 * paired with a matching undo. This is where the click-to-score
 * interaction deferred since Sprint 1 finally gets wired up for real.
 *
 * Every action still logs through services/timelineService.js (so it
 * shows up in the Student Profile's timeline immediately), but this
 * service also keeps a small, session-only, per-classroom undo stack —
 * not persisted, and not the same thing as the Timeline itself. Undoing
 * removes the specific timeline entry the action created and reverses
 * whatever it changed (score, badge, or bucket), so "Undo" here means
 * "take it back entirely," not "log a correction" — different from
 * revoking a badge from the full Student Profile, which deliberately
 * keeps the history entry.
