/**
 * services/workspaceService.js
 *
 * Orchestrates the Workspace: loading every classroom a teacher belongs
 * to from Firestore in real time, creating/updating/deleting them, and
 * migrating existing data forward exactly once per account. This is the
 * module the UI/router layer talks to for anything workspace- or
 * classroom-level — it never touches Firestore directly, only the
 * repository contract (see repositories/classroomRepository.js).
 *
 * Architecture: UI -> workspaceService (here) -> repository -> Firestore.
 *
 * SHARED CLASSROOMS (this phase): a teacher's classrooms are no longer
 * "their own collection" — each classroom is one shared document any
 * member can read/write, and a teacher's *list* of accessible classrooms
 * is a separate pointer collection (users/{uid}/classroomRefs). So this
 * file now runs a "listener of listeners":
 *   1. One live listener on the teacher's classroomRefs (which
 *      classrooms am I a member of right now?).
 *   2. As that list changes, open or close one live listener per
 *      classroom document referenced — never more than the teacher
 *      actually belongs to, never a duplicate of the same document.
 * Every mutation still updates the in-memory copy immediately (instant
 * UI), then fires an async, incremental write for just the one
 * classroom that changed.
