/**
 * repositories/identity/StudentLinkRepository.js
 *
 * The persistence contract behind linking a Google (or future
 * Microsoft/SSO/OTP) account to one or more students. A production
 * implementation would back this with the Firestore collections
 * documented below; DemoStudentLinkRepository.js backs it with
 * in-memory fixture data instead, for building and reviewing this
 * whole architecture without touching real student records.
 *
 * Proposed Firestore model for a future production implementation
 * (not built this phase — documented here so the interface shape
 * below is designed against something real, not invented in a vacuum):
 *
 *   identityLinks/{providerUserId}
 *     { provider: 'google', studentRefs: [{ classroomId, studentId }],
 *       lastSelectedStudentId, linkedAt }
 *   — the actual account-to-student mapping, keyed by provider user id
 *     (not classroom or student id) so lookups on sign-in are a single
 *     document read. `provider` is stored per-link so a future
 *     Microsoft/SSO/OTP provider can write into the same collection
 *     without a schema change.
 *
 *   A student's PIN lives ON the existing student object inside its
 *   classroom document (student.portalPin, student.portalPinGeneratedAt)
 *   — reusing the classroom/team/student model that already exists,
 *   rather than a parallel top-level `students` collection, per Bloom
 *   Labs' stated "reuse existing Firestore data" philosophy.
 *
 *   invitationTokens/{token}
 *     { classroomId, studentId, expiresAt, used, createdAt }
 *   — single-use, expiring invitation links, in their own small
 *     collection (the same reasoning as the co-teacher join-code
 *     collection built earlier: a token needs to be resolvable by an
 *     unlinked visitor, which full classroom documents can't safely
 *     allow — see that feature's own CHANGELOG entry).
