# Classroom Tracker

A lightweight, offline-first tool to help Teach For India Fellows track classroom
performance, behavioural observations, and student progress — built with plain
HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with no external frameworks or backend
dependencies.

> **Status:** Architecture scaffolding milestone. No features are implemented
> yet — this milestone establishes the project structure only. See
> [`docs/problem-statement.md`](docs/problem-statement.md) for the problem
> this project aims to solve.

### Why this structure?

- **`models/`** — describes *what the data looks like*, with no logic attached.
- **`services/`** — describes *what the app can do* with that data (business
  logic), independent of how it's displayed or stored.
- **`storage/`** — isolates persistence behind an adapter interface, so the
  storage backend (currently browser `localStorage`) can be swapped later
  without touching services or UI.
- **`ui/`** — isolates all DOM manipulation and rendering, so it can be
  changed or rebuilt without affecting business logic.
- **`utils/`** — small, reusable, dependency-free helpers used across layers.
- **`config/`** — centralises the app's vocabulary and tunable settings
  (Event types, scoring weights, general app config) so they aren't
  hardcoded or duplicated across services, models, and the future UI.
- **`data/`** — holds fictional fixture/sample data for local development,
  kept separate from anything a Fellow actually enters.
- **`assets/`** — static, non-code assets (icons, images) used by the UI,
  kept separate from application logic.

This separation keeps each layer independently testable and lets us build
features incrementally without reworking the foundation.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Classroom Tracker is built around a single core concept: the **Event**.
Rather than storing and mutating a student's "current state" directly
(e.g. overwriting a progress field), the app records discrete, timestamped
Events — an academic update, a behavioural note, an attendance mark — and
derives current state, history, and trends from that event log.

- **`models/Event.js`** defines the shape of a single Event.
- **`config/actionTypes.js`** defines the fixed vocabulary of Event types
  the app understands (e.g. `academic`, `behavioural`, `attendance`).
- **`config/scoringConfig.js`** defines how each Event type contributes to
  any derived scores or standings.
- **`services/eventService.js`** contains the logic for recording and
  querying Events.

This approach keeps a full, auditable history of everything logged for a
student or classroom, and makes it straightforward to add new Event types
or scoring rules later without reshaping existing data.

## Getting Started

This project has no build step. As of Sprint 4 it has one external
runtime dependency — Firebase Authentication, loaded via CDN for Google
Sign-In — everything else is still plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS. You'll
need a modern web browser and a local static file server (to avoid
`file://` CORS restrictions, and because Google Sign-In requires a real
`http(s)://` origin).

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd classroom-tracker
```

### 2. Set up Firebase Authentication

The app won't sign anyone in until this is done — see
[`src/js/config/firebaseConfig.js`](src/js/config/firebaseConfig.js) for
the full checklist:

1. Create (or open) a project at the
   [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Project Settings → General → "Your apps" → add a Web app, and copy
   its config object into `firebaseConfig.js`, replacing the
   placeholders.
3. Authentication → Sign-in method → enable **Google**.
4. Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains → add whatever domain
   you're serving the app from (`localhost` is included by default).

### 3. Serve the project locally

Any static file server works. For example, using Python:

```bash
cd src
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Or using Node's `http-server` (if installed globally):

```bash
npx http-server src -p 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### 4. Formatting

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for consistent code
formatting. Configuration lives in `.prettierrc`. If you have Prettier
installed:

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```
